Of course, the population mean $\mu_p$ is unknown and probably can never be known.
This specific sample mean $\mu_0$ is nothing but like an advanced educated guess. Then again, how do we know if our this specific sample mean $\mu_0$ is a faithful representation of the population mean? In fact, this question is not limited to mean. It applies to any statistical measurement.
The Statistical Estimation Theory Solution to This Problem
In statistical estimation theory, we would tell the sample value with some indication of the degrees of faithfulness.</description></item><item><title>Types of Errors in Statistical Hypothesis Testing</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/type-1-error-and-type-2-error/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/type-1-error-and-type-2-error/</guid><description>Type I and Type II Errors In statistical hypothesis testing, we always have a null hypothesis $H_0$ which refers to the statement to be tested. We have two possible conclusions from a hypothesis testing,
to accept the hypothesis, that is concluding that $H_0$ is true, to reject the hypothesis, that is concluding that $H_0$ is false. However, it is possible that our conclusion is not correct. There are four possible results.
$H_0$ is True (Ground Truth) $H_0$ is False (Ground Truth) Accept $H_0$ (after hypothesis testing) Correct Type II Error Reject $H_0$ (after hypothesis testing) Type I Error Correct We could tell that there are two types of errors:</description></item><item><title>Neyman-Pearson Theory</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/neyman-pearson-theory/</link><pubDate>Sat, 02 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/neyman-pearson-theory/</guid><description>The Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing tests two hypothesis, hypothesis $H$, and an alternative hypothesis $H_A$.
Neyman-Pearson Lemma The Neyman-Pearson Lemma is an very intuitive lemma to understand how to choose a hypothesis. The lecture notes from PennState is a very good read on this topic1.
An example For simplicity, we assume that there exists a test statistic $T$ and $T$ can be used to measure how likely the hypothesis $H$ is true, e.g., the hypothesis $H$ is false, corresponds to $T$ being small.
The reference from Shafer2007 assumes a random variable $T$ to be large if the hypothesis $H$ is false[^Shafer2007]. One example is the ratio of likelihood2,</description></item><item><title>Statistical Sign Test</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/sign-test/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/sign-test/</guid><description>We have a small dataset, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t satisfy the t-test conditions. Then we would use as little assumptions as possible.
Wine Taste Suppose we have two bottles of wine, one of them is 300 euros while the other is 100 euros.
Now we ask the question:
Does expensive wine taste better?
We find 10 experts and give them some experiments. The result is recorded then processed into the following table.
expert # expensive is better 1 yes 2 no 3 yes 4 yes 5 yes 6 no 7 yes 8 yes Naively, we could simply count the number of yes and find the probability of yes in this sample, i.</description></item><item><title>Mann-Whitney U Test</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/mann-whitney-u-test/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/mann-whitney-u-test/</guid><description>Mann-Whitney U is good at [[hypothesis testing]] Statistical Hypothesis Testing hypothesis testing is about the probability of alternative hypothesis if the null hypothesis is true, or even more general heavy-tailed data.</description></item></channel></rss>
