These notes are being used as a skeleton framework. There are many useful books to learn about algorithms from a utilitarian point of view. I have listed a few in the references section.
Numerical recipes is a very comprehensive book that I used during my PhD. It covers almost all the algorithms you need for scientific computing.</description></item><item><title>Data Structure</title><link>/wiki/algorithms/data-structure/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/algorithms/data-structure/</guid><description>Dealing with data structure is like dealing with your clothes. Some people randomly drop their clothes somewhere without thinking. But it takes time to retrieve a specific T-shirt. Some people spend more time folding and arranging their clothes. This process makes it easy to find a specific T-shirt. Similar to retrieving clothes, there is always a balance between the computation time (retrieving clothes) and the coding time (folding clothes).

Linear: $f(a X_1(t) + b X_2(t)) = a f(X_1(t)) + b f(X_2(t))$ Time-invariant: input $X(t+\Delta t)$ will produce the shifted signal $Y(t+\Delta t)$. LTI systems are memory systems, casual, real, and stable.</description></item><item><title>Basics of MapReduce</title><link>/wiki/algorithms/map-reduce/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/algorithms/map-reduce/</guid><description>Centralized servers are not efficient for big data. Querying and processing data on centralized servers would reach bottleneck of the servers.
MapReduce is used to solve these problems of big data. The two videos are .
Map: take series of key-value pairs and divide them into groups. Reduce: recombine the key-value pairs Checkout the code challenges of MapReduce on HackerRank.</description></item></channel></rss>
