Representation: encode data and problem representation, i.e., propose a space to set a stage. Evaluation: an objective function to be evaluated that guides the model. Optimization: an algorithm to optimize the model so it learns what we want it to do. Table from Domingos2012
Machine Learning Workflow There are many objectives in machine learning. Two of the most applied objectives are classifications and regressions. In classifications and regression, the following four factors are relevant.
A simple framework of machine learning.</description></item></channel></rss>
