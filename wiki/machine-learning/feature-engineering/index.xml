The first widely spread theory, or level of measurement, is by S. Stevens. The theory categorizes data into four types, nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.
Other methods are proposed for other fields of research. For example, N. R. Chrisman proposed a different method for cartography. However, these are not generic enough for data science. They are more general than a specific field of research.
For machine learning, many statistical data types have been proposed. Some examples of data types and their relations with the level of measurement are shown in the following chart.</description></item><item><title>Dealing with Missing Data in Machine Learning</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/feature-engineering/missing-data/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Aug 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/feature-engineering/missing-data/</guid><description>How to Deal with Missing Data Remove Listwise deletion: Remove the whole record; Works if the missing values are random. Removing values causes problem in many aspects. For example, we can not just delete data when applying our models. Replace with most frequent value central tendency: median, mean, etc fixed value: a string etc New Category: define a new category for missing data Convert the column to a binary valued column indicating if the feature is missing or not. Tools pandas sklearn: Imputer @ResidentMario/missingno : visualize missing data</description></item></channel></rss>
