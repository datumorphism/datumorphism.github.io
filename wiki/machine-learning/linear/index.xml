Suppose a dataset have features $F_\alpha$ where $\alpha = 1, 2, \cdots, K$, with corresponding class labels $G_\alpha$. The dataset that provides $N$ datapoints with each deoted as $X_i$. The posterior of the classification is $P(G = G_\alpha \vert X = X_i)$.
A naive idea is to classify the data into two classes $m$ and $n$ using the boundary of a linear model
$$ P(G = G_\alpha \vert X = X_i) = P(G = G_\beta \vert X = X_i).</description></item><item><title>Poisson Regression</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/poisson-regression/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/poisson-regression/</guid><description>Poisson regression is a generalized linear model for count data.
To model a dataset that is generated from a Poisson distribution, we only need to model the mean $\mu$ as it is the only parameters. The simplest model we can have for some given features $X$ is a linear model. However, for count data, the effects of the predictors are often multiplicative. The next simplest model we can have is
$$ \mu = \exp\left(\beta X\right). $$
The $\exp$ makes sure that the mean is positive as this is required for count data.</description></item><item><title>Logistic Regression</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/logistic-regression/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/logistic-regression/</guid><description>In a classification problem, given a list of features values $x$ and their corresponding classes $\{c_i\}$, the posterior for of the classes, aka conditional probability of the classes, is
$$ p(C=c_i\mid X=x). $$
Likelihood
The likelihood of the data is
$$ p(X=x\mid C=c_i). $$
Logistic Regression for Two Classes For two classes, the simplest model for the posterior is a linear model,
$$ \log \frac{p(C=c_1\mid X=x) }{p(C=c_2\mid X=x)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x, $$
which is equivalent to
$$ p(C=c_1\mid X=x) = \exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x\right) p(C=c_2\mid X=x) . $$
