Problems with Conditional Probability Calculation By definition, the conditional probability of event $\mathbf Y$ given features $\mathbf X$ is $$ \begin{equation} P(\mathbf Y\mid \mathbf X) = \frac{P(\mathbf Y, \mathbf X)}{ P(\mathbf X) }, \label{def-cp-y-given-x} \end{equation} $$ where</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Linear Regression</title><link>/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/bayesian-linear-regression/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/bayesian-linear-regression/</guid><description>Linear Regression and Likelihood The linear estimator $y$ is
$$ \begin{equation} y^n = \beta^m X_m^{\phantom{m}n}. \label{eq-linear-model} \end{equation} $$
As usual, we have redefined our data to get rid of the intercept $\beta^0$.
In ordinary linear models, we find the error being the difference between the target $\hat y$ and the estimator $y$
$$ \epsilon = \hat y - y, $$
which is required to have a minimum absolute value.
In linear regressions, we use least squares to solve the problem.</description></item><item><title>Latent Variable Models</title><link>/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/latent-variable-models/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/latent-variable-models/</guid><description>In the view of statistics, we know everything about a physical system if we know the probability $p(\mathbf s)$ of all possible states of the physical system $\mathbf s$. Time can also be part of the state specification.
As an example, we will classify fruits into oranges and non oranges. We will have the state vector $\mathbf s = (\text{is orange}, \text{texture } x)$. Our goal is to find the join probability $p(\text{is orange}, x)$.</description></item></channel></rss>
