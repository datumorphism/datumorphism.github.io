Problems with Conditional Probability Calculation By definition, the conditional probability of event $\mathbf Y$ given features $\mathbf X$ is $$ \begin{equation} P(\mathbf Y\mid \mathbf X) = \frac{P(\mathbf Y, \mathbf X)}{ P(\mathbf X) }, \label{def-cp-y-given-x} \end{equation} $$
where
$P(\mathbf X)$ is probability of an event having the features $\mathbf X$, $P(\mathbf Y, \mathbf X)$ is the probability of the event $Y$ with features $\mathbf X$.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Linear Regression</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/bayesian-linear-regression/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/bayesian-linear-regression/</guid><description>Linear Regression and Likelihood The linear estimator $y$ is
$$ \begin{equation} y^n = \beta^m X_m^{\phantom{m}n}. \label{eq-linear-model} \end{equation} $$
As usual, we have redefined our data to get rid of the intercept $\beta^0$.
In ordinary linear models, we find the error being the difference between the target $\hat y$ and the estimator $y$
$$ \epsilon = \hat y - y, $$
which is required to have a minimum absolute value.
In linear regressions, we use least squares to solve the problem. In Bayesian linear regression, instead of using a deterministic estimator $\beta^m X_m^{\phantom{m}n}$, we assume a Gaussian random estimator
$$ \begin{equation} \mathcal{N}(\mu, \sigma^2) = \mathcal{N}(\beta^m X_m^{\phantom{m}n}, \sigma^2), \end{equation} $$</description></item><item><title>Evidence Lower Bound: ELBO</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/elbo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 12 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/elbo/</guid><description>This article reuses a lot of materials from the references. Please see the references for more details on ELBO. Given a probability distribution density $p(X)$ and a latent variable $Z$, we have the marginalization of the joint probability
$$ \int dZ p(X, Z) = p(X). $$
Using Jensen&amp;rsquo;s Inequality In many models, we are interested in the log probability density $\log p(X)$ which can be decomposed using an auxiliary density of the latent variable $q(Z)$,
$$ \begin{align} \log p(X) =&amp; \log \int dZ p(X, Z) \\ =&amp; \log \int dZ p(X, Z) \frac{q(Z)}{q(Z)} \\ =&amp; \log \int dZ q(Z) \frac{p(X, Z)}{q(Z)} \\ =&amp; \log \mathbb E_q \left[ \frac{p(X, Z)}{q(Z)} \right].</description></item><item><title>Latent Variable Models</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/latent-variable-models/</link><pubDate>Wed, 27 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/bayesian/latent-variable-models/</guid><description>In the view of statistics, we know everything about a physical system if we know the probability $p(\mathbf s)$ of all possible states of the physical system $\mathbf s$. Time can also be part of the state specification.
As an example, we will classify fruits into oranges and non oranges. We will have the state vector $\mathbf s = (\text{is orange}, \text{texture } x)$. Our goal is to find the joint probability $p(\text{is orange}, x)$.
The reality, we only have sample data. This sample data usually can not cover all the possible states of the system. Thus a direct calculation to find the joint probability $p(\mathbf s)$ is not feasible.</description></item></channel></rss>
