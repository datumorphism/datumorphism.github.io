Based on a data sample, we could reconstruct some sort of theoretical models to represent the actual generating process.
Which is a Good Model? (1)The black curve represent the generating process. The red rectangle is a very simple model that captures some major samples. The blue step-wise model is capturing more sample data but with more parameters.
In the above example, the red model on the left is not that good in most cases while the blue model seems to be better. In reality, the choice depends on the usage of the model.</description></item><item><title>Goodness-of-fit</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/model-selection/goodness-of-fit/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/model-selection/goodness-of-fit/</guid><description>Does the data agree with the model?
Calculate the distance between data and model predictions. Apply Bayesian methods such as likelihood estimation: likelihood of observing the data if we assume the model; the results will be a set of fitting parameters. &amp;hellip; Why don&amp;rsquo;t we always use goodness-of-fit as a measure of the goodness of a model?
We may experience overfitting. The model may not be intuitive. This is why we would like to balance it with parsimony using some measures of generalizability.
K-means and overfitting
The overfitting problem is easily demonstrated using the K-means model.
Suppose we use $k=1$, i.</description></item><item><title>Measures of Generalizability</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/model-selection/measures-of-generalizability/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/model-selection/measures-of-generalizability/</guid><description>To measure the generalization, we define a generalization error,
$$ \begin{align} \mathcal G = \mathcal L_{P}(\hat f) - \mathcal L_E(\hat f), \end{align} $$
where $\mathcal L_{P}$ is the population loss, $\mathcal L_E$ is the empirical loss, and $\hat f$ is our model by minimizing the empirical loss.
However, we do not know the actual joint probability $p(x, y)$ of our dataset $\{x_i, y_i\}$. Thus the population loss is not known. In machine learning, we usually use [[cross validation]] Cross Validation Cross validation is a method to estimate the [[risk]] The Learning Problem The learning problem proposed by Vapnik:1 Given a sample: $\{z_i\}$ in the probability space $Z$; Assuming a probability measure on the probability space $Z$; Assuming a set of functions $Q(z, \alpha)$ (e.</description></item><item><title>Parsimony of Models</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/model-selection/parsimony-of-models/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/model-selection/parsimony-of-models/</guid><description>For models with a lot of parameters, the goodness-of-fit is very likely to be very high. However, it is also likely to generalize bad. So we need measure of generalizability
Here parsinomy gives us a few advantages.

A fully connected network has great expressing power but it is easily overfitting.
One strategy is to apply constraints to the networks:
Limit the connections; Shared weights in subgroups of the network; Constrain the weights using some probability distributions. By minimizing the MDL of the network and the misfits on the data, we can build a concise network. Based on the [[Source Coding Theorem]] Coding Theory Concepts The code function produces code words.</description></item></channel></rss>
