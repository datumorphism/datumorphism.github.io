To discuss this problem, we need a framework for learning. Operationally, we can think of learning as the following framework1.
Abu-Mostafa2012
Naive View Naively speaking, a model should have two key properties,
enough capacity to hold the necessary information embedded in the data, and a method to find the combination of parameters so that the model can generate/complete new data. Most neural networks have enough capacity to hold the necessary information in the data2. The problem is, the capacity is so large. Why does backprop even work? How did backprop find a suitable set of parameters that can generalize?</description></item><item><title>VC Dimension</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/learning-theory/vc-dimension/</link><pubDate>Sun, 21 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/learning-theory/vc-dimension/</guid><description>Two of the key elements in a learning problem are:
a set of hypothesis $\mathcal H$, and a set of data samples $\mathcal S$. $\mathcal H$
Inside $\mathcal H$, we have a lot of hypotheses, for example, $\mathcal h$. Given some input, e.g., $x_1$ and $x_2$, we can produce some outputs, e.g., $h(x_1)$ and $h(x_2)$. $\mathcal S$
A sample $\mathcal S$ is a fair sample drawn from all the possible inputs $\mathcal X$, where $\mathcal X$ is called the input space. A dataset $\mathcal S$ can be used as a probe of the hypothesis set $\mathcal H$.</description></item></channel></rss>
