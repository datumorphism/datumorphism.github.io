For example, the sample mean is easily calculated. However, it is the population mean that is more valuable.
Suppose we have one sample $S_i$, which is used to calculate the mean of the sample $\mu_i$. We have two key problems to solve at this moment.
Can we use this sample mean $\mu_i$ to represent the population mean $\mu_p$? How good is our estimations? To answer these questions, we need to work out the properties of the samples themselves and work out a theory to instruct us to infer population statistics from sample statistics.</description></item><item><title>Confidence Interval</title><link>/wiki/statistical-estimation/confidence-interval/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/statistical-estimation/confidence-interval/</guid><description>We will use upper cases for the abstract variable and lower cases for the actual numbers.
Why is Confidence Interval Needed? Suppose I sample the population multiple times, the mean value $\mu_i$ of the sample is calculated for each sample. It is a good question to ask how different these $\mu_i$ are compared to the true mean $\mu_p$ of the population.
In this article, we would need to specify several notations.</description></item></channel></rss>
