The reference explains this concept very well. For consistency, I extracted a paragraph from it which explains the operations in Levenshtein algorithm. The source of the following paragraph is the first reference of this article.

Cell (0:1) contains red number 1. It means that we need 1 operation to transform M to an empty string.</description></item><item><title>n-gram</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/math/n-gram/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/math/n-gram/</guid><description>n-gram is a method to split words into set of substring elements so that those can be used to match words.
Examples Use the following examples to get your first idea about it. I created two columns so that we could compare the n-grams of two different words side-by-side.
n in n-gram is Word One Clean Word: (( sentenceOneWords )) n-grams: (( sentenceOneWordsnGram )) Word Two Clean Word: (( sentenceTwoWords )) n-grams: (( sentenceTwoWordsnGram )) /*************************/ /** The function nGram is a copy of https://github.</description></item><item><title>Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/math/tf-idf/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/math/tf-idf/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
