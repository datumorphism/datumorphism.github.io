Instead of using one decision tree and model on all the features, the decision tree method can model on a random set of features (feature subspace) using many decision trees and make decisions by democratizing the trees.
Given a proper dataset $\mathscr D(\mathbf X, \mathbf y)$, the ensemble of trees is denoted as ${f_i(\mathbf X)}$, will predict an ensemble of results. There are several key ideas in random forests.
Are the predicted results representative? How to democratize the ensemble of results? What determines the quality of the predictions? Margin, Strength, and Correlations The margin of the model, the strength of the trees, and the correlation between the trees are crucial to answer the questions.</description></item></channel></rss>
