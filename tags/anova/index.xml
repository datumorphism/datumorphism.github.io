The null hypothesis to be used is
The distributions of several groups are the same.
ANOVA tests the null hypothesis by comparing the variability between groups and within groups. If the variability between groups are significantly larger than the variability within groups, we are more confident that the distributions of different groups are different.
We will use two-group experiments as an example. We use a fake dataset:
Group A $x^A_1$ $x^A_2$ &amp;hellip; $x^A_{N_A}$ Group B $x^B_1$ $x^B_2$ &amp;hellip; $x^B_{N_B}$ Within Group Variability The within group variability is proportional to</description></item></channel></rss>
