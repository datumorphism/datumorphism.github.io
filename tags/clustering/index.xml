$$ \mathbf S_{\text{Katz}}[u,v] = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta^i \mathbf A^i[u, v], $$
where $\mathbf A^i[u, v]$ is the matrix $\mathbf A$ to the $i$th power. Some for $\beta^i$. The Katz index describes the similarity between of node $u$ and node $v$.
Do not confuse power with contravariant indices
For readers familiar with tensor notations, it might be confusing. We some times use contravariant indices on the top right of the tensor notation.
But here ${}^{i}$ means to the $i$th power.
The index is proved to be the following
$$ \mathbf S_{\text{Katz}} = (\mathbf I - \beta \mathbf A)^{-1} - \mathbf I.</description></item><item><title>Graph Global Overlap Measure: Leicht-Holme-Newman Index</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-leicht-holme-newman-similarity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-leicht-holme-newman-similarity/</guid><description>From Katz Index to LHN Index Katz Index Graph Global Overlap Measure: Katz Index The Katz index is $$ \mathbf S_{\text{Katz}}[u,v] = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta^i \mathbf A^i[u, v], $$ where $\mathbf A^i[u, v]$ is the matrix $\mathbf A$ to the $i$th power.

There are some nice and clear examples on wikipedia1, for example, $$ \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ for the graph Public Domain, Link and $\mathbf D$ is a diagonalized matrix with the diagonal elements being the degrees.</description></item><item><title>Graph Local Overlap Measure: Adamic Adar Index</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-local-overlap-adamic-adar-index/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-local-overlap-adamic-adar-index/</guid><description>The Adamic Adar (AA) index is1
$$ \mathbf S_{\text{AA}}[v_1,v_2] = \sum_{u\in\mathcal N(u) \cap \mathcal N(v)} \frac{1}{\log d_u}, $$
where $d_u$ is the node degree of node $u$ and $\mathcal N(u)$ is the neighbor nodes of $u$.
If two nodes have shared neighbor, the degree of the neighbors will be at least 2. So it is safe to use $1/\log d_u$.
