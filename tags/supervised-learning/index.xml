Suppose a dataset have features $F_\alpha$ where $\alpha = 1, 2, \cdots, K$, with corresponding class labels $G_\alpha$. The dataset that provides $N$ datapoints with each deoted as $X_i$. The posterior of the classification is $P(G = G_\alpha \vert X = X_i)$.
A naive idea is to classify the data into two classes $m$ and $n$ using the boundary of a linear model
$$ P(G = G_\alpha \vert X = X_i) = P(G = G_\beta \vert X = X_i).</description></item><item><title>Decision Tree</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/tree-based/decision-tree/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/tree-based/decision-tree/</guid><description>In this article, we will explain how decision trees work and build a tree by hand.
The code used in this article can be found in this repo. Definition of the problem We will decide whether one should go to work today. In this demo project, we consider the following features.
feature possible values health 0: feeling bad, 1: feeling good weather 0: bad weather, 1: good weather holiday 1: holiday, 0: not holiday For more compact notations, we use the abstract notation $\{0,1\}^3$ to describe a set of three features each with 0 and 1 as possible values.</description></item><item><title>Logistic Regression</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/logistic-regression/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/logistic-regression/</guid><description>In a classification problem, given a list of features values $x$ and their corresponding classes $\{c_i\}$, the posterior for of the classes, aka conditional probability of the classes, is
$$ p(C=c_i\mid X=x). $$
Likelihood
The likelihood of the data is
$$ p(X=x\mid C=c_i). $$
Logistic Regression for Two Classes For two classes, the simplest model for the posterior is a linear model,
$$ \log \frac{p(C=c_1\mid X=x) }{p(C=c_2\mid X=x)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x, $$
which is equivalent to
$$ p(C=c_1\mid X=x) = \exp\left(\beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x\right) p(C=c_2\mid X=x) . $$

Instead of using one decision tree and model on all the features, the decision tree method can model on a random set of features (feature subspace) using many decision trees and make decisions by democratizing the trees.
Given a proper dataset $\mathscr D(\mathbf X, \mathbf y)$, the ensemble of trees is denoted as ${f_i(\mathbf X)}$, will predict an ensemble of results. There are several key ideas in random forests.
Are the predicted results representative? How to democratize the ensemble of results? What determines the quality of the predictions? Margin, Strength, and Correlations The margin of the model, the strength of the trees, and the correlation between the trees are crucial to answer the questions.</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Classification</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/classification/hierarchical-classification/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/classification/hierarchical-classification/</guid><description>Hierarchical Classification Problem Hierarchical classification labels involves hierarchical class labels. The hierarchical class labels maybe predefined or inferred. 1
Class Taxonomy A hierarchical classification problem comes with a class taxonomy.
&amp;ldquo;IS-A&amp;rdquo; operator: $\prec$, &amp;ldquo;IS-NOT-A&amp;rdquo; operator: $\nprec$ A IS-A relationship of the labels $c_a$ class set $C$ is
one root $R$ in the tree, asymmetric, i.e., $c_i \prec c_j$ and $c_j\prec c_i$ can not be both true, anti-reflexive, i.e., $c_i \nprec c_i$, transitive, i.e., $c_i \prec c_j$ and $c_j\prec c_k$ $\Rightarrow$ $c_i \prec c_k$. There are different representations of the hierarchical taxonomies.

Many different approaches are proposed to solve such problems.
Algorithm Level Develop algorithms for multilabel problems, such as
Decision trees, AdaBoost. Problem Transformation On problem or data level, we can transform the multi-label problem to one or more single label problems.
Binary Relevance Method Binary relevance method, aka BM, transforms the problem into a single label problem by training a binary classifier for each label.
By doing so, the correlations between the target labels are lost.
Label Combination Method Label combination method (label power-set method), aka CM, combines the labels into single labels.</description></item></channel></rss>
