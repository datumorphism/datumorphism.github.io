Computers stores everything in binary form 1. Suppose we randomly get some segments in the memory, we have no idea what that stands for since we do not know the type of data it represents.
Some of the most used data types in data science are
integer, float, string, time. Integers Integers can occupy $2^0$, $2^1$, $2^2$, $2^3$ bytes in memory.
1 byte : | | | | | | | | | 2 bytes: | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | 4 bytes: | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | | .</description></item></channel></rss>
