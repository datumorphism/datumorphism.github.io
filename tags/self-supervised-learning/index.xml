Many different GANs are proposed. Vanilla GAN has a simple structure with a single discriminator and a single generator. It uses the minmax game setup. However, it is not stable to use minmax game to train a GAN model. WassersteinGAN was proposed to solve the stability problem during training1. More advanced GANs like BiGAN and ALI have more complex structures.
Vanilla GAN Minmax Game Suppose we have two players $G$ and $D$, and a utility $v(D, G)$, a minmax game is maximizing the utility $v(D, G)$ for the worst case of $G=\hat G$ that minimizes $v$ then we have to find $D=\hat D$ that maximizes $v$, i.</description></item><item><title>Contrastive Model: Context-Instance</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/context-instance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/context-instance/</guid><description>In contrastive methods, we can manipulate the data to create data entries and infer the changes using a model.

$$ \begin{equation} \log p_\theta (x) = \sum_{t=1}^T \log p_\theta ( x_{t} \mid {x_{&amp;lt;t}} ). \end{equation} $$
In the above example, the likelihood is modeled as
$$ \begin{align} p_\theta (x) &amp;= \Pi_{t=1}^T p_\theta (x_t \mid x_{1:t-1}) \\ &amp;= p_\theta(x_2 \mid x_{1:1}) p_\theta(x_3 \mid x_{1:2}) \cdots p_\theta(x_T \mid x_{1:T-1}) \end{align} $$
Taking the log of it
$$ \ln p_\theta (x) = \sum_{t=1}^T \ln p_\theta (x_t \mid x_{1:t-1}) $$
Notations and Conventions
In AR models, we have to mention the preceding nodes (${x_{&amp;lt;t}}$) of a specific node ($x_{t}$). For $t=5$, the relations between ${x_{&amp;lt;5}}$ and $x_5$ is shown in the following illustration.</description></item><item><title>Contrastive Model: Instance-Instance</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/instance-instance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/instance-instance/</guid><description>It was discovered that the success of [[mutual information based contrastive learning]] Contrastive Model: Context-Instance In contrastive methods, we can manipulate the data to create data entries and infer the changes using a model.

The relations between the two distributions is established using the conservation law for distributions, $\int p(x) \mathrm d x = \int \tilde p (z) \mathrm d z = 1$. One could imagine that changing the variable also brings in the Jacobian.

Why not just use the global mutual information of the input and encoder output as the objective?
&amp;hellip; maximizing MI between the complete input and the encoder output (i.e.,globalMI) is ofteninsufficient for learning useful representations.
&amp;ndash; Devon et al[^Devon2018]
[[Mutual information]] Mutual Information Mutual information is defined as $$ I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p_{XY}} \ln \frac{P_{XY}}{P_X P_Y}. $$ In the case that $X$ and $Y$ are independent variables, we have $P_{XY} = P_X P_Y$, thus $I(X;Y) = 0$.

The simplest auto-encoder is rather easy to understand.
The loss can be chosen based on the demand, e.g., cross entropy for binary labels.
Notation: dot ($\cdot$)
We use a single vertically centered dot, i.e., $\cdot$, to indicate that the function or machine can take in arguments. A simple autoencoder can be achieved using two neural nets, e.g.,
$$ \begin{align} {\color{green}h} &amp;amp;= {\color{blue}g}{\color{blue}(}{\color{blue}b} + {\color{blue}w} x{\color{blue})} \ \hat x &amp;amp;= {\color{red}\sigma}{\color{red}(c} + {\color{red}v} {\color{green}h}{\color{red})}, \end{align} $$
where in this simple example,
${\color{blue}g(b + w \cdot )}$ is the encoder, and ${\color{red}\sigma(c + v \cdot )}$ is the decoder.</description></item><item><title>Variational Auto-Encoder</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/generative-models/variational-autoencoder/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/generative-models/variational-autoencoder/</guid><description>In an inference problem, $p(z\vert x)$, which is used to infer $z$ from $x$.
$$ p(z\vert x) = \frac{p(x, z)}{p(x)}. $$
For example, we have an observable $x$ and a latent space $z$, we would like to find a good latent space for the observable $x$. However, $p(x)$ is something we don&amp;rsquo;t really know. We would like to use some simpler quantities to help us inferring $z$ from $x$ or generating $x$ from $z$.
Now we introduce a simple distribution $q(z\vert x)$. We want to make sure this $q(z\vert x)$ is doing a good job of replacing $p(z\vert x)$, i.e., minimizing the [[KL divergence]] KL Divergence Kullback–Leibler divergence indicates the differences between two distributions ,</description></item><item><title>Generative Models</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/generative-models/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/generative-models/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Contrastive Models</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Adversarial Models</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/adversarial-models/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/adversarial-models/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Self-supervised Learning: Generative or Constrastive</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/reading/self-supervised-learning-generative-or-contrastive-2006.08218/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/reading/self-supervised-learning-generative-or-contrastive-2006.08218/</guid><description>Review of self-supervised learning.</description></item></channel></rss>
