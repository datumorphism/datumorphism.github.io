However, before we understand how data is represented visually, it would benefit us a lot if we understand the basic principles of designing on 2D surface.
Robin&amp;rsquo;s CRAP Robin Williams proposed the four elements of design:
Contrast Repetition Alignment Proximity Contrast Use some contrast to distinguish the elements of different contents.
Repetition Repeat the design of similar elements on the same page and across pages to make sure the readers learn the meaning of the design quickly.

Hue Saturation When we add another dimension, lightness, to the wheel, we have a color sphere (1, 2).
Many color systems have been invented. Color wheel and color sphere are two examples of them.</description></item></channel></rss>
