However, before we understand how data is represented visually, it would benefit us a lot if we understand the basic principles of designing on 2D surface.
Robin&amp;rsquo;s CRAP Robin Williams proposed the four elements of design:
Contrast Repetition Alignment Proximity Contrast Use some contrast to distinguish the elements of different contents.

Hue Saturation When we add another dimension, lightness, to the wheel, we have a color sphere (1, 2).
Many color systems have been invented. Color wheel and color sphere are two examples of them.</description></item></channel></rss>
