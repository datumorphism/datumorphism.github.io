These notes are being used as a skeleton framework. There are many useful books to learn about algorithms from a utilitarian point of view. I have listed a few in the references section.
Numerical recipes is a very comprehensive book that I used during my PhD. It covers almost all the algorithms you need for scientific computing.</description></item><item><title>Basics of MapReduce</title><link>/wiki/algorithms/map-reduce/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/algorithms/map-reduce/</guid><description>Centralized servers are not efficient for big data. Querying and processing data on centralized servers would reach bottleneck of the servers.
MapReduce is used to solve these problems of big data. The two videos are .
Map: take series of key-value pairs and divide them into groups. Reduce: recombine the key-value pairs Checkout the code challenges of MapReduce on HackerRank.</description></item></channel></rss>
