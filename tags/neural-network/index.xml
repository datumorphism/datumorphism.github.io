The Idea The essence of the MaxEnt model is that the underlying probability distribution $p(x)$ of the random variables $x$ should
gives the whole system the largest uncertainty, while producing reasonable observables. Uncertainty The uncertainty of the whole system is described by the Shannon entropy based on the probability distributions $p(x)$,</description></item><item><title>Restricted Boltzmann Machine</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/energy-based-model/restricted-boltzmann-machine/</link><pubDate>Fri, 11 Jun 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/energy-based-model/restricted-boltzmann-machine/</guid><description>Latent variables introduce extra correlations between the nodes in a network. Introducing hidden units can also help us remove the direct connection between some nodes in a Boltzmann machine and create a restricted Boltzmann machine. A restricted Boltzmann machine requires less computation while having some expressing power.
Given Ising like interactions between the nodes, flipping node V1 is likely to also flip node V2 as they are connected through hidden unit H1.</description></item><item><title>MDL and Neural Networks</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/model-selection/mdl-and-neural-networks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/model-selection/mdl-and-neural-networks/</guid><description>Minimum Description Length ( MDL MDL is a measure of how well a model compresses data by minimizing the combined cost of the description of the model and the misfit. ) can be used to construct a concise network. A fully connected network has great expressing power but it is easily overfitting.
One strategy is to apply constraints to the networks:
Limit the connections; Shared weights in subgroups of the network; Constrain the weights using some probability distributions.</description></item><item><title>McCulloch-Pitts Model</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/neural-networks/mcculloch-pitts-model/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/neural-networks/mcculloch-pitts-model/</guid><description>The McCulloch-Pitts model maps the input $\{x_1, x_2,\cdots, x_i \cdots, x_N \}$ into a scalar $y\in\{1,-1\}$,
$$ y = \operatorname{sign}( w\cdot x - b). $$
Since $w\cdot x - b = 0$ is a hyperplane, the McCulloch-Pitts model separates the state space using this hyperplane. The shift $b$ determines the interception, and $w$ decides the slope.</description></item><item><title>Rosenblatt's Perceptron</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/neural-networks/rosenblatt-perceptron/</link><pubDate>Thu, 25 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/neural-networks/rosenblatt-perceptron/</guid><description>Rosenblatt&amp;rsquo;s perceptron connects McCulloch-Pitts neurons in levels.
Rosenblatt proposed that we fix all the weights and leave the weights of the last neuron free.
The first few layers but the last layer is used as a transformation of the input data ${x_1, \cdots, x_i, \cdots, x_N}$ into a new space ${z_1, \cdots, z_i, \cdots, z_{N&amp;rsquo;}}$. The classification is done on the ${z_1, \cdots, z_i, \cdots, z_{N&amp;rsquo;}}$ space by tuning the last neuron.</description></item><item><title>Overcoming catastrophic forgetting in neural networks</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/reading/overcoming-catastrophic-forgetting-in-neural-networks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 May 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/reading/overcoming-catastrophic-forgetting-in-neural-networks/</guid><description>Using a newly defined loss function the authors could implement an idea that achieves the multi-task within one network.</description></item></channel></rss>
