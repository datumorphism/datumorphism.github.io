Everything in this post is meant for fun. I moved to Germany a few weeks ago. One of the most interesting things here is beer. People are drinking so much, yet the life expectance of Germany is pretty high. So I came up with this broken joke &amp;ldquo;analysis&amp;rdquo; for fun.
Life expectancy vs beer consumption (L) per capita per year. Data obtained from wikipediaList of countries by life expectancy and List of countries by beer consumption per capita.
As you might be curious about the life expectancy vs the life expectancy, I also made one plot about it.</description></item></channel></rss>
