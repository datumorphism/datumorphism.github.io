These methods are models that &amp;ldquo;predict relative position&amp;rdquo;1. Common tricks are
shuffling image sections like jigsaw, and rotate the image. We can also adjust the model to discriminate the similarities and differences. For example, to generate contrast, we can also use [[Mutual Information]] Mutual Information Mutual information is defined as $$ I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p_{XY}} \ln \frac{P_{XY}}{P_X P_Y}. $$ In the case that $X$ and $Y$ are independent variables, we have $P_{XY} = P_X P_Y$, thus $I(X;Y) = 0$.</description></item><item><title>Contrastive Predictive Coding</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/contrastive-predictive-codeing/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/contrastive-predictive-codeing/</guid><description>Contrastive Predictive Coding, aka CPC, is an autoregressive model combined with InfoNCE loss1.
There are two key ideas in CPC:
Autoregressive models in latent space, and InfoNCE loss that combines mutual information and [[NCE]] Noise Contrastive Estimation: NCE Noise contrastive estimation (NCE) objective function is1 $$ \mathcal L = \mathbb E_{x, x^{+}, x^{-}} \left[ - \ln \frac{ C(x, x^{+})}{ C(x,x^{+}) + C(x,x^{-}) } \right], $$ where $x^{+}$ represents data similar to $x$, $x^{-}$ represents data dissimilar to $x$, $C(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a function to compute the similarities. For example, we can use $$ C(x, x^{+}) = e^{ f(x)^T f(x^{+}) }, $$ so that the objective function becomes $$ \mathcal L = \mathbb E_{x, x^{+}, x^{-}} \left[ - \ln \frac{ e^{ … .</description></item><item><title>Deep Infomax</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/deep-infomax/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/deep-infomax/</guid><description>Max Global Mutual Information
Why not just use the global mutual information of the input and encoder output as the objective?
&amp;hellip; maximizing MI between the complete input and the encoder output (i.e.,globalMI) is ofteninsufficient for learning useful representations.

[[Mutual information]] Mutual Information Mutual information is defined as $$ I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p_{XY}} \ln \frac{P_{XY}}{P_X P_Y}. $$ In the case that $X$ and $Y$ are independent variables, we have $P_{XY} = P_X P_Y$, thus $I(X;Y) = 0$. This makes sense as there would be no &amp;ldquo;mutual&amp;rdquo; information if the two variables are independent of each other.</description></item><item><title>Mutual Information</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/information/mutual-information/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/information/mutual-information/</guid><description>Mutual information is defined as

Entropy and Cross Entropy Mutual information is closely related to entropy. A simple decomposition shows that
$$ I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X\mid Y), $$
which is the reduction of uncertainty in $X$ after observing $Y$.
KL Divergence This definition of mutual information is equivalent to the following [[KL Divergence]] KL Divergence Kullback–Leibler divergence indicates the differences between two distributions ,</description></item></channel></rss>
