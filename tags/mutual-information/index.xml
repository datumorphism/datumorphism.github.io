These methods are models that &amp;ldquo;predict relative position&amp;rdquo;1. Common tricks are
shuffling image sections like jigsaw, and rotate the image. We can also adjust the model to discriminate the similarities and differences. For example, to generate contrast, we can also use Mutual Information Mutual Information Mutual information is defined as $$ I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p_{XY}} \ln \frac{P_{XY}}{P_X P_Y}.</description></item><item><title>Mutual Information</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/information/mutual-information/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/information/mutual-information/</guid><description>Mutual information is defined as
$$ I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p_{XY}} \ln \frac{P_{XY}}{P_X P_Y}. $$
In the case that $X$ and $Y$ are independent variables, we have $P_{XY} = P_X P_Y$, thus $I(X;Y) = 0$. This makes sense as there would be no &amp;ldquo;mutual&amp;rdquo; information if the two variables are independent of each other.
Entropy and Cross Entropy Mutual information is closely related to entropy. A simple decomposition shows that
$$ I(X;Y) = H(X) - H(X\mid Y), $$</description></item></channel></rss>
