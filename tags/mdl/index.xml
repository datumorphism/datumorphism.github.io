Based on a data sample, we could reconstruct some sort of theoretical models to represent the actual generating process.
Which is a Good Model? (1)The black curve represent the generating process. The red rectangle is a very simple model that captures some major samples. The blue step-wise model is capturing more sample data but with more parameters.</description></item><item><title>MDL and Neural Networks</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/model-selection/mdl-and-neural-networks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/model-selection/mdl-and-neural-networks/</guid><description>Minimum Description Length ( MDL MDL is a measure of how well a model compresses data by minimizing the combined cost of the description of the model and the misfit. ) can be used to construct a concise network. A fully connected network has great expressing power but it is easily overfitting.
One strategy is to apply constraints to the networks:
Limit the connections; Shared weights in subgroups of the network; Constrain the weights using some probability distributions.</description></item><item><title>Minimum Description Length</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/mdl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/mdl/</guid><description>The minimum description length, aka, MDL, is based on the relations between regularity and data compression. (See Kolmogorov complexity Description of Data The measurement of complexity is based on the observation that the compressibility of data doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on the &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo; used to describe the compression process that much. This makes it possible for us to find a universal language, such as a universal computer language, to quantify the compressibility of the data.</description></item></channel></rss>
