import numpy as np n = 10 v = np.random.randn(n) v_c = v - v.mean() This operation is easy and obvious. However, the formalism is not elegant. In some cases, we would like to formulate the process of centering the elements as operators,
$$ v_c = \operatorname{\hat H}v. $$
In this case, the operator $\operatorname{\hat H}$ is simply a matrix
$$ \operatorname{\hat H} \to I_n - \frac{1}{n} J_n, $$
where $n$ is the dimension of the vector $v$, $I_n$ is a identity matrix, $J_n$ is a matrix of all $1$s.</description></item><item><title>SVD: Singular Value Decomposition</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/math/svd/</link><pubDate>Tue, 18 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/math/svd/</guid><description>Given a matrix $\mathbf X \to X_{m}^{\phantom{m}n}$, we can decompose it into three matrices
$$ X_{m}^{\phantom{m}n} = U_{m}^{\phantom{m}k} D_{k}^{\phantom{k}l} (V_{n}^{\phantom{n}l} )^{\mathrm T}, $$
where $D_{k}^{\phantom{k}l}$ is diagonal.
Here we have $\mathbf U$ being constructed by the eigenvectors of $\mathbf X \mathbf X^{\mathrm T}$, while $\mathbf V$ is being constructed by the eigenvectors of $\mathbf X^{\mathrm T} \mathbf X$ (which is also the reason we keep the transpose).
I find this slide from Christoph Freudenthaler very useful. The original slide has been added as a reference to this article.
