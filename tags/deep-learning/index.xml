A safe but time wasting option is to use search on a grid of parameters. However, there are smarter moves.
Karpathyâ€™s Constant
An empirical learning rate $3^{-4}$ for Adms, aka, Karpathy's constant, was started as a tweet by Andrei Karpathy. 3e-4 is the best learning rate for Adam, hands down.

&amp;mdash; Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) November 24, 2016 Smarter Method A smarter method is to start with small learning rate and increase it on each mini-batch, then observe the loss vs learning rate (mini-batch in this case).</description></item></channel></rss>
