For $k$ such subsets of nodes, $\mathcal A_1, \cdots, $\mathcal A_k$, the cut is the total number of edges between $\mathcal A$ and $\bar{\mathcal A}$ 1,
$$ \operatorname{Cut} \left( \mathcal A_1, \cdots, $\mathcal A_k \right) = \frac{1}{2} \sum_{k=1}^K \lvert (u, v)\in \mathcal E: u\in \mathcal A_k, v\in \bar{\mathcal A_k} \rvert. $$
For smaller cut value, the proposed patches $\mathcal A_1, \cdots, \mathcal A_k$ are more disconnected from the overall graph.
This definition is biased towards smaller graphlets, i.</description></item><item><title>Graph Laplacians</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-laplacians/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-laplacians/</guid><description>Laplacian is a useful representation of graphs. The unnormalized Laplacian is
$$ \mathbf L = \mathbf D - \mathbf A, $$
where $\mathbf A$ is the adjacency matrix Graph Adjacency Matrix A graph $\mathcal G$ can be represented with an adjacency matrix $\mathbf A$. Multiplication of Adjacency Matrices Multiplication of adjacency matrices tells us about the path between nodes. $A[u,v]$ is the length-1 path between node $u$ and $v$. If $A[u,v]=0$, there is no path. If $A[u,v]=1$, we have a length-1 path. For $A^2[u,v]$, we have $$ A^2_{uv} = \sum_k A_{uk}A_{kv}. $$ This is the length-2 path. If node $u$ or node $v$ has no neighbors, $A^2_{uv}=0$.</description></item><item><title>Heterophily on Graph</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/heterophily/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/heterophily/</guid><description>Heterophily is the tendency to differ from others. Heterophily on a graph is the tendency to connect to nodes that are different from itself, e.g., nodes with different attributes have higher probability of edge.</description></item></channel></rss>
