For example, we have a bunch of cat photos and the user labeled &amp;ldquo;cute or not&amp;rdquo; data. Now we are using the labeled data to train a cute-or-not binary classifier.
Then we apply the classifier on the test dataset and we would only find four different kinds of results.</description></item><item><title>Linear Methods</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/linear-methods/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/linear-methods/</guid><description>Solving Classification Problems with Linear Models One simple idea behind classification is to calculate the posterior probability of each class given the variables.
Suppose a dataset have features $F_\alpha$ where $\alpha = 1, 2, \cdots, K$, with corresponding class labels $G_\alpha$. The dataset that provides $N$ datapoints with each deoted as $X_i$. The posterior of the classification is $P(G = G_\alpha \vert X = X_i)$.
A naive idea is to classify the data into two classes $m$ and $n$ using the boundary of a linear model</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning Overview</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/overview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/overview/</guid><description>What is Machine Learning There are many objectives in machine learning. Two of the most applied objectives are classifications and regressions. In classifications and regression, the following four factors are relevant.
A simple framework of machine learning. The dataset $\tilde{\mathscr D}$ is first encoded by $\mathscr T$, $\mathscr D(\mathbf X, \mathbf Y) = \mathscr T(\tilde{\mathscr D})$. The dataset is feeded into the model, $\bar{\mathbf Y} = f(\mathbf X;\mathbf \theta)$.</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Learning</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/unsupervised/overview/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/unsupervised/overview/</guid><description>Unsupervised Learning!
Principle components analysis Clustering K-means Clustering Algorithm:
Assign data points to a group Iterate through until no change: Find centroid Find the point that is closest to the centroids. Assign that data point to the corresponding group of the centroids. How Many Groups
The art of chosing K. Hierarchical Clustering Bottom-up hierarchical groups can be read out from the dendrogram.</description></item><item><title>Decision Tree</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/tree-based/decision-tree/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/tree-based/decision-tree/</guid><description>In this article, we will explain how decision trees work and build a tree by hand.
The code used in this article can be found in this repo. Definition of the problem We will decide whether one should go to work today. In this demo project, we consider the following features.
feature possible values health 0: feeling bad, 1: feeling good weather 0: bad weather, 1: good weather holiday 1: holiday, 0: not holiday For more compact notations, we use the abstract notation $\{0,1\}^3$ to describe a set of three features each with 0 and 1 as possible values.</description></item><item><title>Bias-Variance</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/basics/bias-variance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Jun 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/basics/bias-variance/</guid><description>Bias and Variance Suppose $f(X)$ is a perfect model that represents a &amp;ldquo;tight&amp;rdquo; model of the dataset $(X,Y)$ but some irredicible error $\epsilon$,
$$ \begin{equation} Y = f(X) + \epsilon. \label{dataset-using-true-model} \end{equation} $$
On the other hand, we build another model using a specific method such as k-nearest neighbors, which is denoted as $k(X)$.
Why the two models?
Why are we talking about the perfect model and a model using a specific method?</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Learning: PCA</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/unsupervised/pca/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/unsupervised/pca/</guid><description>We use the Einstein summation notation in this article. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used trick for dimensionality reduction so that the new features represents most of the variances of the data.
Representations of Dataset In theory, a dataset can be represented by a matrix if we specify the basis. However, the initial given basis is not always the most convinient one. Suppose we find a new set of basis for the dataset, the matrix representation may be simpler and easier to use.</description></item><item><title>Random Forest</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/tree-based/random-forest/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/tree-based/random-forest/</guid><description>Random forest is an ensemble method based on decision trees. Instead of using one decision tree and model on all the features, the decision tree method can model on a random set of features (feature subspace) using many decision trees and make decisions by democratizing the trees.
Given a proper dataset $\mathscr D(\mathbf X, \mathbf y)$, the ensemble of trees is denoted as ${f_i(\mathbf X)}$, will predict an ensemble of results.</description></item><item><title>Unsupervised Learning: SVM</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/unsupervised/svm/</link><pubDate>Fri, 17 Aug 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/unsupervised/svm/</guid><description>SVM is calculating a hyperplane to separate the data points into groups according to the label.
Hyperplane A hyperplane is defined to be of the following form
$$ \begin{equation} \boldsymbol{\beta} \cdot \mathbf x = \beta_0. \end{equation} $$
where $\boldsymbol\beta$ is the normal vector to the plane and is required to be constant.
It is straight forward to show that the distance $d$ from an arbitrary point $\mathbf x'$ to the hyperplane is</description></item><item><title>My Data Wiki</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/projects/wiki/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/projects/wiki/</guid><description>A collection of my wiki articles related to data.</description></item><item><title>My Knowledge Cards</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/projects/cards/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/projects/cards/</guid><description>A collection of my snippets of knowledge</description></item><item><title>My Reading Notes</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/projects/reading/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/projects/reading/</guid><description>A collection of my reading notes</description></item><item><title>TIL</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/projects/til/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Apr 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/projects/til/</guid><description>Today I Learned</description></item></channel></rss>
