Of course, the population mean $\mu_p$ is unknown and probably can never be known.
This specific sample mean $\mu_0$ is nothing but like an advanced educated guess. Then again, how do we know if our this specific sample mean $\mu_0$ is a faithful representation of the population mean? In fact, this question is not limited to mean.</description></item><item><title>Why Estimation Theory</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-estimation/why-estimation-theory/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-estimation/why-estimation-theory/</guid><description>In statistics, we work with samples. For example, the sample mean is easily calculated. However, it is the population mean that is more valuable.
Suppose we have one sample $S_i$, which is used to calculate the mean of the sample $\mu_i$. We have two key problems to solve at this moment.
Can we use this sample mean $\mu_i$ to represent the population mean $\mu_p$? How good is our estimations? To answer these questions, we need to work out the properties of the samples themselves and work out a theory to instruct us to infer population statistics from sample statistics.</description></item><item><title>What is Statistics</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/what-is-statistics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/what-is-statistics/</guid><description>A Case Study We have a problem.
In our lab, we found a huge amount of similar robots on a planet (physical population). To know more about the weight of these robots (statistical population), we first need to choose some of them (physical sample), then obtain the weight of them (statistical sample).
To describe the data, we could calculate the mean of the weight. We found that the mean weight is 93kg (descriptive statistics).</description></item><item><title>Machine Learning Basics</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/basics/</link><pubDate>Mon, 05 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/basics/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Data Types and Level of Measurement in Machine Learning</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/feature-engineering/data-types/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/feature-engineering/data-types/</guid><description>Types of Data There are several debatable categorization methods of data.
The first widely spread theory, or level of measurement, is by S. Stevens. The theory categorizes data into four types, nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.
Other methods are proposed for other fields of research. For example, N. R. Chrisman proposed a different method for cartography. However, these are not generic enough for data science. They are more general than a specific field of research.</description></item><item><title>Types of Errors in Statistical Hypothesis Testing</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/type-1-error-and-type-2-error/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/type-1-error-and-type-2-error/</guid><description>Type I and Type II Errors In statistical hypothesis testing, we always have a null hypothesis $H_0$ which refers to the statement to be tested. We have two possible conclusions from a hypothesis testing,
to accept the hypothesis, that is concluding that $H_0$ is true, to reject the hypothesis, that is concluding that $H_0$ is false. However, it is possible that our conclusion is not correct. There are four possible results.</description></item><item><title>Confidence Interval</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-estimation/confidence-interval/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-estimation/confidence-interval/</guid><description>We will use upper cases for the abstract variable and lower cases for the actual numbers.
Why is Confidence Interval Needed? Suppose I sample the population multiple times, the mean value $\mu_i$ of the sample is calculated for each sample. It is a good question to ask how different these $\mu_i$ are compared to the true mean $\mu_p$ of the population.

Wine Taste Suppose we have two bottles of wine, one of them is 300 euros while the other is 100 euros.
Now we ask the question:

We find 10 experts and give them some experiments.

Min-max Normalization This method is linear and straightforward.
Suppose we are analyzing series A, with elements $a_i$. We already know the min and max of the series, $a_{min}$ and $a_{max}$.
Now we would like to normalize the series to be within the range $[a_{min}', a_{max}']$. We simply solve the value of $a&amp;rsquo; _ i$ in $$ \frac{(a&amp;rsquo;_i - a_{min}')}{ ( a&amp;rsquo;_{max} - a&amp;rsquo;_{min} ) } = \frac{(a_i - a_{min})}{ ( a_{max} - a_{min} ) }, $$ where everything on the right hand side is known and $a_{min}&amp;lsquo;$ and $a_{max}&amp;lsquo;$ are chosen as the new min and max to be scaled to.</description></item><item><title>Linear Regression</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/linear-regression/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/linear-regression/</guid><description>In this article, we will use the Einstein summation convention.
