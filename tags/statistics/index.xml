Of course, the population mean $\mu_p$ is unknown and probably can never be known.
This specific sample mean $\mu_0$ is nothing but like an advanced educated guess. Then again, how do we know if our this specific sample mean $\mu_0$ is a faithful representation of the population mean? In fact, this question is not limited to mean. It applies to any statistical measurement.
The Statistical Estimation Theory Solution to This Problem
In statistical estimation theory, we would tell the sample value with some indication of the degrees of faithfulness.</description></item><item><title>Why Estimation Theory</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-estimation/why-estimation-theory/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-estimation/why-estimation-theory/</guid><description>In statistics, we work with samples. For example, the sample mean is easily calculated. However, it is the population mean that is more valuable.
Suppose we have one sample $S_i$, which is used to calculate the mean of the sample $\mu_i$. We have two key problems to solve at this moment.
Can we use this sample mean $\mu_i$ to represent the population mean $\mu_p$? How good is our estimations? To answer these questions, we need to work out the properties of the samples themselves and work out a theory to instruct us to infer population statistics from sample statistics.</description></item><item><title>What is Statistics</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/what-is-statistics/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/what-is-statistics/</guid><description>A Case Study We have a problem.
In our lab, we found a huge amount of similar robots on a planet (physical population). To know more about the weight of these robots (statistical population), we first need to choose some of them (physical sample), then obtain the weight of them (statistical sample).
To describe the data, we could calculate the mean of the weight. We found that the mean weight is 93kg (descriptive statistics).
We could simply give a number to standard for the mean weight of all the robots. (point estimate) We could tell a number as the mean weight of all the robots together with a range that tells us how disperse our measurement is.</description></item><item><title>Statistics of Graphs</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/graph/basics/statistics-of-graphs/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/graph/basics/statistics-of-graphs/</guid><description>Local Statistics Node Degree Node Degree Node degree of a node $u$ $$ d_u = \sum_{v\in \mathcal V} A[u,v], $$ where $A$ is the adjacency matrix.

The first widely spread theory, or level of measurement, is by S. Stevens. The theory categorizes data into four types, nominal, ordinal, interval, and ratio.
Other methods are proposed for other fields of research. For example, N. R. Chrisman proposed a different method for cartography. However, these are not generic enough for data science. They are more general than a specific field of research.
For machine learning, many statistical data types have been proposed. Some examples of data types and their relations with the level of measurement are shown in the following chart.</description></item><item><title>Types of Errors in Statistical Hypothesis Testing</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/type-1-error-and-type-2-error/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/type-1-error-and-type-2-error/</guid><description>Type I and Type II Errors In statistical hypothesis testing, we always have a null hypothesis $H_0$ which refers to the statement to be tested.

where $n$ is the number of elements in series A.
The standard deviation is very easy to understand. It is basically the average Eucleadian distance between the data points and the average value. In this article, we will take another point of view.

Min-max Normalization This method is linear and straightforward.

Now we would like to normalize the series to be within the range $[a_{min}', a_{max}']$. We simply solve the value of $a' _ i$ in $$ \frac{(a'i - a{min}')}{ ( a'{max} - a'{min} ) } = \frac{(a_i - a_{min})}{ ( a_{max} - a_{min} ) }, $$ where everything on the right hand side is known and $a_{min}'$ and $a_{max}'$ are chosen as the new min and max to be scaled to.</description></item><item><title>Linear Regression</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/linear-regression/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/linear-regression/</guid><description>In this article, we will use the Einstein summation convention.

Power Iteration The solution to $\mathbf e$ is the eigenvector that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$. Power iteration method can help us get this eigenvector, i.e., the $^{(t+1)}$ iteration is related to the previous iteration $^{(t)}$, through the following relation,

The Bernoulli distribution describes the probability of $K$ results with state $s$ being $s=A$ and $N-K$ results with state $s$ being $B$ after $N$ experiments,
$$ P\left(\sum_i^N s_i = K \right) = C _ N^K p^K (1 - p)^{N-K}. $$</description></item><item><title>Beta Distribution</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/distributions/beta/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/distributions/beta/</guid><description>Beta Distribution Interact {% include extras/vue.html %}

Lorentz distribution is frequently used in physics.

$$ \frac{1}{\pi\gamma} \left( \frac{\gamma^2}{ (x-x_0)^2 + \gamma^2} \right) $$
The median and mode of the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution is always $x_0$. $\gamma$ is the FWHM.

Covariance of two discrete series $A$ and $B$ is defined as
$$ \text{Cov} ({A,B}) = \sigma_{A,B}^2 = \frac{ (a_i - \bar A) (b_i - \bar B) }{ n- 1 }, $$
where $n$ is the length of the series. The normalization factor is set to $1/(n-1)$ to mitigate the bias for small $n$.
One could show that
$$ \mathrm{Cov}({A,B}) = E( A,B ) - \bar A \bar B. $$
At first glance, the square in the definition seems to be only for notation purpose at this point.
Meanwhile, using this idea of the mean of geometric mean, we could easily generalize it to the covariance of three series,</description></item><item><title>Jackknife Resampling</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/jacknife-resampling/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/jacknife-resampling/</guid><description>Jackknife resampling is a method for estimation of the mean and higher order moments.
Given a sample $\{x_i\}$ of size $n$ for the distribution $X$, the jackknife resampling estimates the mean by leaving out each data point systematically. $n$ estimations of the mean will be obtained, with each of the estimations $x_i$
$$ \bar x_i = \frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{j\neq i} x_j. $$
The mean of the sample is
$$ \bar x = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i \bar x_i = \frac{1}{n} \sum_i \left(\frac{1}{n-1} \sum_{j\neq i} x_j\right) = \frac{1}{n}\sum_i x_i. $$
The result is consistent with other sample mean methods. Jackknife estimates the variance of the sample</description></item><item><title>CramÃ©r's V</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/cramers-v/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/cramers-v/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Kendall Tau Correlation</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/kendall-correlation-coefficient/</link><pubDate>Sat, 20 Jul 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/kendall-correlation-coefficient/</guid><description>Definition two series of data: $X$ and $Y$ cooccurance of them: $(x_i, x_j)$, and we assume that $i&amp;lt;j$ concordant: $x_i &amp;lt; x_j$ and $y_i &amp;lt; y_j$; $x_i &amp;gt; x_j$ and $y_i &amp;gt; y_j$; denoted as $C$ discordant: $x_i &amp;lt; x_j$ and $y_i &amp;gt; y_j$; $x_i &amp;gt; x_j$ and $y_i &amp;lt; y_j$; denoted as $D$ neither concordant nor discordant: whenever equal sign happens Kendall&amp;rsquo;s tau is defined as
