Of course, the population mean $\mu_p$ is unknown and probably can never be known.
This specific sample mean $\mu_0$ is nothing but like an advanced educated guess. Then again, how do we know if our this specific sample mean $\mu_0$ is a faithful representation of the population mean? In fact, this question is not limited to mean.</description></item><item><title>Types of Errors in Statistical Hypothesis Testing</title><link>/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/type-1-error-and-type-2-error/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/type-1-error-and-type-2-error/</guid><description>Type I and Type II Errors In statistical hypothesis testing, we always have a null hypothesis $H_0$ which refers to the statement to be tested. We have two possible conclusions from a hypothesis testing,
to accept the hypothesis, that is concluding that $H_0$ is true, to reject the hypothesis, that is concluding that $H_0$ is false. However, it is possible that our conclusion is not correct. There are four possible results.</description></item><item><title>Statistical Sign Test</title><link>/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/sign-test/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/sign-test/</guid><description>We have a small dataset, but it doesn&amp;rsquo;t satisfy the t-test conditions. Then we would use as little assumptions as possible.
Wine Taste Suppose we have two bottles of wine, one of them is 300 euros while the other is 100 euros.
Now we ask the question:
Does expensive wine taste better?
We find 10 experts and give them some experiments. The result is recorded then processed into the following table.</description></item><item><title>Mann-Whitney U Test</title><link>/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/mann-whitney-u-test/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/statistical-hypothesis-testing/mann-whitney-u-test/</guid><description>Mann-Whitney U is good at testing heavy-tailed data.</description></item></channel></rss>
