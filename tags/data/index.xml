$$ F(\tilde x) = \int f(x) \psi(x;\tilde x) dx. $$
The choice of $\psi(x;\tilde x)$ gives us different properties.
Fourier Transform Fourier transform is good for stationary analysis since time is not involved in $F(\omega)$.
$$ F(\omega) = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} f(t) e^{-i \omega t} dt $$
Short-time Fourier Transform STFT is a Fourier transform with a moving time window $\tau$,</description></item><item><title>Sugar</title><link>/wiki/sugar/</link><pubDate>Wed, 20 Jun 2018 15:58:49 -0400</pubDate><guid>/wiki/sugar/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Data Types</title><link>/cards/machine-learning/datatypes/data-types/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cards/machine-learning/datatypes/data-types/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Gini Impurity</title><link>/cards/machine-learning/measurement/gini-impurity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cards/machine-learning/measurement/gini-impurity/</guid><description>The code used in this article can be found in this repo. Suppose we have a dataset $\{0,1\}^{10}$, which has 10 records and 2 possible classes of objects $\{0,1\}$ in each record.
The first example we investigate is a pure 0 dataset.
object 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 For such an all-0 dataset, we would like to define its impurity as 0.</description></item><item><title>Information Gain</title><link>/cards/machine-learning/measurement/information-gain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cards/machine-learning/measurement/information-gain/</guid><description>Information gain is a frequently used metric in calculating the gain during a split in tree-based methods.
First o all, the entropy of a dataset if defined as
$$ S = - sum_i p_i \log p_i - sum_i (1-p_i)\log p_i, $$
where $p_i$ is the probability of a class.
The information gain is the difference between the entropy.
For example, in a decision tree algorithm, we would split a node. Before splitting, we assign a label $m$ to the node,</description></item><item><title>PAC: Probably Approximately Correct</title><link>/cards/machine-learning/learning-theories/pac/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cards/machine-learning/learning-theories/pac/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
