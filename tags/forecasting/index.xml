$\mathcal P$, the priors, e.g., price and demand is negatively correlated, $\mathcal D$, available dataset, $Y$, the observations, and $F$, the forecasts. Information Set $\mathcal A$
The priors $\mathcal D$ and the available data $\mathcal P$ can be summarized together as the information set $\mathcal A$. Under a probabilistic view, a forecaster will find out or approximate a CDF $\mathcal F$ such that1
$$ \mathcal F(Y\vert \mathcal D, \mathcal P) \to F. $$
Naively speaking, once the density $\rho(F, Y)$ is determined or estimated, a probabilistic forecaster can be formed.</description></item><item><title>Forecasting</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/forecasting/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/forecasting/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Continuous Ranked Probability Score - CRPS</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/time-series/crps/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Mar 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/time-series/crps/</guid><description>The Continuous Ranked Probability Score, known as CRPS, is a score to measure how a proposed distribution approximates the data, without knowledge about the true distributions of the data.
Definition CRPS is defined as1
$$ CRPS(P, x_a) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty \lVert P(x) - H(x - x_a) \rVert_2 dx, $$
where
$x_a$ is the true value of $x$, P(x) is our proposed cumulative distribution for $x$, $H(x)$ is the Heaviside step function $$ H(x) = \begin{cases} 1, &amp;\qquad x=0\\ 0, &amp;\qquad x\leq 0\\ \end{cases} $$
$\lVert \cdot \rVert_2$ is the L2 norm. Explain it The formula looks abstract on first sight, but it becomes crystal clear once we understand it.</description></item><item><title>StemGNN</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/reading/stemgnn/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/reading/stemgnn/</guid><description>What problem is StemGNN solving: intra-series temporal pattern: DFT Each series inter-series correlations At each step, the interactions between nodes reversible operator Example problem Covid cases: DE, AT, NL, &amp;hellip; Predicting each country without considering the interactions between them Or introduce the people flow between them GFT: Completes DFT as it takes care of the inter-series correlations one extra slide for this topic Convolutions on Graphs one extra slide for this topic Graph Basics How to build the graph &amp;ldquo;self-attention&amp;rdquo;: outer product of key, query, as the adjacency matrix key, query are of length # of ndoes Weights and Biases LC 1DConv GLU FC Experiments Traffic adjacency matrix neighbouring sensors have higher correlations Covid Neighbouring countries have higher correlation Spetral analysis: Some eigenvectors have clear meanings Week spots Paper and code are not consistent https://github.</description></item></channel></rss>
