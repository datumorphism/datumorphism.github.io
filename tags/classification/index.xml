Problems with Conditional Probability Calculation By definition, the conditional probability of event $\mathbf Y$ given features $\mathbf X$ is $$ \begin{equation} P(\mathbf Y\mid \mathbf X) = \frac{P(\mathbf Y, \mathbf X)}{ P(\mathbf X) }, \label{def-cp-y-given-x} \end{equation} $$ where</description></item><item><title>Confusion Matrix (Contingency Table)</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/basics/confusion-matrix/</link><pubDate>Fri, 31 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/basics/confusion-matrix/</guid><description>Confusion Matrix It is much easier to understand the confusion matrix if we use a binary classification problem as an example. For example, we have a bunch of cat photos and the user labeled &amp;ldquo;cute or not&amp;rdquo; data. Now we are using the labeled data to train a cute-or-not binary classifier.
Then we apply the classifier on the test dataset and we would only find four different kinds of results.</description></item><item><title>Linear Methods</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/linear-methods/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/linear-methods/</guid><description>Solving Classification Problems with Linear Models One simple idea behind classification is to calculate the posterior probability of each class given the variables.
Suppose a dataset have features $F_\alpha$ where $\alpha = 1, 2, \cdots, K$, with corresponding class labels $G_\alpha$. The dataset that provides $N$ datapoints with each deoted as $X_i$. The posterior of the classification is $P(G = G_\alpha \vert X = X_i)$.
A naive idea is to classify the data into two classes $m$ and $n$ using the boundary of a linear model</description></item><item><title>Logistic Regression</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/logistic-regression/</link><pubDate>Thu, 27 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/linear/logistic-regression/</guid><description>In a classification problem, given a list of features values $x$ and their corresponding classes $\{c_i\}$, the posterior for of the classes, aka conditional probability of the classes, is
$$ p(C=c_i\mid X=x). $$ Likelihood
The likelihood of the data is
$$ p(X=x\mid C=c_i). $$
Logistic Regression for Two Classes For two classes, the simplest model for the posterior is a linear model,
$$ \log \frac{p(C=c_1\mid X=x) }{p(C=c_2\mid X=x)} = \beta_0 + \beta_1 \cdot x, $$ which is equivalent to</description></item><item><title>Classification</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/classification/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/classification/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Valid Confidence Sets in Multiclass and Multilabel Prediction</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/classification/valid-confidence-sets-in-multiclass-multilabel-prediction/</link><pubDate>Thu, 08 Apr 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/classification/valid-confidence-sets-in-multiclass-multilabel-prediction/</guid><description>Ask for valid confidence:

$n$ observations, desired confidence level $1-\alpha$, construct confidence sets $C(x)$ using conform methods so that the sets capture the underlying the distribution a new pair $(X_{n+1}, Y_{n+1})$ from the same distribution, $P(Y_{n+1}\in C(X_{n+1})) \le 1-\alpha$</description></item><item><title>Hierarchical Classification</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/classification/hierarchical-classification/</link><pubDate>Tue, 30 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/classification/hierarchical-classification/</guid><description>Hierarchical Classification Problem Hierarchical classification labels involves hierarchical class labels.

Class Taxonomy A hierarchical classification problem comes with a class taxonomy.

Many different approaches are proposed to solve such problems.
Algorithm Level Develop algorithms for multilabel problems, such as
Decision trees, AdaBoost. Problem Transformation On problem or data level, we can transform the multi-label problem to one or more single label problems.
Binary Relevance Method Binary relevance method, aka BM, transforms the problem into a single label problem by training a binary classifier for each label.</description></item></channel></rss>
