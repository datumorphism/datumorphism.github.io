Air-density variations within these swirls give the atmosphere a refractive index (a parameter that determines how the air bends light) that varies rapidly in space and time. Such a highly inhomogeneous refractive index distorts images of astronomical objects taken from the ground. To correct for these distortions, users can adjust the shapes of some mirrors in the telescopes in such a way that it effectively \u201cundoes\u201d the atmospheric distortions. This method works best when the turbulence is weak, says James Osborn, an atmospheric physicist at Durham University, UK. If the turbulence is strong, as is the case when a big weather front comes through, the data can require an extensive postprocessing that includes making complex on-sky measurements to tease out the details of the site\u2019s turbulence. In extreme cases, the data may have to be thrown out."

The three tools presented all make those forecasts: one tool does so on a global scale, another aims for rapid time measurements, and one gleans information from real-time weather parameters."

This information could allow observatories to leverage information about the spatial distribution of turbulence to improve performance. To test the model, a research team used wind speed and direction data from local weather stations and balloon launches above the Maunakea Observatory in Hawaii. They then ran their model to map the altitudes of different turbulent layers based on measured winds. They found that they could separate surface layer turbulence (up to 200 m above ground level) from free-atmosphere turbulence (200 m to 2 km above ground level) on 67% of the days that they tested. Dungee says that the data his model provides could help reduce operational costs, as it uses existing wind measurements to determine different turbulent layers and doesn\u2019t need the expensive tools currently used to actively measure those layers. \u201cKnowing which layers contain the most turbulence could lead to cheaper systems overall,\u201d Dungee says."

As well as space observations, turbulence can hinder free-space optical communications, which use laser beams to transmit information from the ground to satellites. Turbulence can cause the beams to flicker or spread, distorting the received signal. \u201cBut if you know that the strongest turbulence is always at a certain height above the ground, you can design a system to take this into account,\u201d Osborn says. \u201cSo, it all comes together.\u201d"
