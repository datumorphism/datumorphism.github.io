    "message": "#ML #self-supervised #representation\n\nContrastive loss is widely used in representation learning. However, the mechanism behind it is not as straightforward as it seems. \n\nWang & Isola proposed a method to rewrite the contrastive loss in to alignment and uniformity. Samples in the feature space are normalized to unit vectors. These vectors are allocated onto a hypersphere. The two components of the contrastive loss are\n\n- alignment, which forces the positive samples to be aligned on the hypersphere, and\n- uniformity, which distributes the samples uniformly on the hypersphere.\n\nBy optimization of such objectives, the samples are distributed on a hypersphere, with similar samples clustered, i.e., pointing to the similar directions. Uniformity makes sure the samples are using the whole hypersphere so we don't waste \"space\".\n\n\nReferences:\n\nWang T, Isola P.
