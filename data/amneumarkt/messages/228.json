    "message": "#career #DS\n\nI believe this article is relevant. \nMost data scientists have very good academic records. These experiences of excellence compete with another required quality in the industry: The ability to survive in a less ideal yet competitive environment.\nWe could be stubborn and find the environment that we fit well in or adapt based on the business playbook. Either way is good for us as long as we find the path that we love.\n\n(I have a joke about this article: To reasoning productively, we do not need references for our claims at all.)\n\nhttps://hbr.org/1991/05/teaching-smart-people-how-to-learn#",
