Some people abide by the priors, they are the prior-people, while others are more like likelihood-people and easily change their belief based on observations. \nThere is a third type. They combine priors and likelihood. Change belief based on likelihood is prone to biases in data. By combining priors and likelihood, they have a better chance of getting to the right conclusion.",
