It\u2019s improved efficiency in businesses, fundamentally changed the advertising landscape, and overhauled healthcare technologies. But for machine learning to continue to grow its impact and reach, the development pipeline has to improve. Systems research is filling this need, by bringing decades of work in database systems, distributed computing, and application deployment to the machine learning space. Machine learning is novel and exciting - but many of its problems are not. By identifying the parallels and \u201ctwisting\u201d old solutions, we can use systems to redesign ML."
