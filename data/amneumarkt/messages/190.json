            "description": "There's a concept I draw on often in social interactions. I've been calling it\nthe \"happy price\", but that is originally terminology by Michael Ellsberg with\nsubtly different implications. So I now fork off the term \"cheerful price\", and\nspecialize it anew.Earlier Facebook discussion here.\n\nTl;dr:\n\n * When I ask you for your Cheerful Price for doing something, I'm asking you\n   for the price that: * Gives you a cheerful feeling about the transaction;\n    * Makes you feel energized about doing the thing;\n    * Doesn't generate an ouch feeling to be associated with\n      me;\n    * Means I'm not expending social capital or friendship\n      capital to make the thing happen;\n    * Doesn't require the executive part of you, that knows\n      you need money in the long-term, to shout down and override other parts of\n      you.\n   \n   \n * The Cheerful Price is not: * A \"fair\" price;\n    * The price you would pay somebody else to do similar work;\n    * The lowest price such that you'd feel sad about\n      learning the\u2026",
