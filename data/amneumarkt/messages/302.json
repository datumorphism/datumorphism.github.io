For example, 100 points are given for solving the first room of Montezuma\u2019s revenge (Fig.1). In the imitation learning setting, humans can transfer knowledge and skills through step-by-step action demonstrations (Fig.2), and the agent then learns to mimic human actions."

We can let human trainers provide both high-level and low-level demonstrations, and do imitation learning at both levels. Alternatively, like conventional imitation learning, humans can provide only low-level action demonstrations, and agents must then extract task hierarchy on their own. A promising combination is to learn goal selection using imitation learning at a high level and let a reinforcement learning agent learn to perform low-level actions to achieve high-level goals. The motivation for this combination is that humans are good at specifying high-level abstract goals while the agents are good at executing low-level fine-grained controls."

On the contrary, in tasks like Tetris, providing low-level demonstration is easier, since high-level goals are not easy to specify. The second concern is safety. Only providing high-level goals requires the agents to learn low-level policies by themselves through trial-and-error, which is suitable for simulated agents but not for physical robots. Therefore in robotic tasks, low-level action demonstrations are often required."

Next, knowing where humans would look provides useful information on what action they will take. Therefore it is intuitive to leverage learned attention models to guide the learning process. The challenge here is how to use human attention in decision learning. The most popular way is to treat the predicted gaze distribution of an image as a filter or a mask. This mask can be applied to the image to highlight the important visual features. Experimental results so far have shown that including gaze information leads to higher accuracy in recognizing or predicting human actions, manipulating objects, driving, cooking, and playing video games."

His research interests include reinforcement learning, robotics, and computational neuroscience, with the goal of developing human-inspired and human-centered AIs. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Austin. His dissertation focused on the attention mechanisms of humans and machines in visuomotor tasks. His research has been recognized by The University of Texas Graduate Fellowship (2014-2017; 2019), and Google AR/VR research award (2017-2018). He is a member of the UT Austin Villa Robot Soccer team and won the 2nd (2016) and 4th (2017) places with the team in the world RoboCup competition."
