    "message": "#academia\n\nData science weekly mentioned this paper.\nhttps://arxiv.org/abs/2304.06035\n\n\nQuote from the abstract:\n\n> A growing number of AI academics can no longer find the means and resources to compete at a global scale. This is a somewhat recent phenomenon, but an accelerating one, with private actors investing enormous compute resources into cutting edge AI research.\n\nAt first, a thought it's an April fools day paper. But it seems serious.\nFor example, the author mentioned the strategy \"Analysis Instead of Synthesis\". This has already happened to many fields. Global scale and money burning experiments in physics left many teams no choice but to take other teams\u2019 data and analyze them.\n\n\nThis is actually quite crazy. Thinking about how AI/ML is developing, it's almost like a paradigm shift of research. \nI read about a discussion on Reddit on a similar topic. Some people are concerned that medical research is also gonna shift to the private sector because of AI, leaving many people no choice but to join these big medical corporates.\n\nOn the other hand, requirements of computing resources also made smaller companies hard to compete in some fields. We need such a guide for business too.",
