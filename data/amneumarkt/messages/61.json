            "description": "In an article recently published in Physical Review Research, we show how deep learning can help solve the fundamental equations of quantum mechanics for real-world systems. Not only is this an important fundamental scientific question, but it also could lead to practical uses in the future, allowing researchers to prototype new materials and chemical syntheses in silico before trying to make them in the lab. Today we are also releasing the code from this study so that the computational physics and chemistry communities can build on our work and apply it to a wide range of problems. We\u2019ve developed a new neural network architecture, the Fermionic Neural Network or FermiNet, which is well-suited to modeling the quantum state of large collections of electrons, the fundamental building blocks of chemical bonds. The FermiNet was the first demonstration of deep learning for computing the energy of atoms and molecules from first principles that was accurate enough to be useful, and it remains the most accurate neural\u2026",

The phrase conjures up images of Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s cat, which can paradoxically be both alive and dead, and fundamental particles that are also, somehow, waves. \u00a0In quantum systems, a particle such as an electron doesn\u2019t have an exact location, as it would in a classical description. Instead, its position is described by a probability cloud - it\u2019s smeared out in all places it\u2019s allowed to be. This counterintuitive state of affairs led Richard Feynman to declare: \u201cIf you think you understand quantum mechanics, you don\u2019t understand quantum mechanics.\u201d Despite this spooky weirdness, the meat of the theory can be reduced down to just a few straightforward equations. The most famous of these, the Schr\u00f6dinger equation, describes the behavior of particles at the quantum scale in the same way that Newton\u2019s laws describe the behavior of objects at our more familiar human scale. While the interpretation of this equation can cause endless head-scratching, the math is much easier to work with, leading to the common exhortation from professors to \u201cshut up and calculate\u201d when pressed with thorny philosophical questions from students."

Their counterintuitive nature leads to all sorts of exotic phenomena: superconductors, superfluids, lasers and semiconductors are only possible because of quantum effects. But even the humble covalent bond - the basic building block of chemistry - is a consequence of the quantum interactions of electrons. Once these rules were worked out in the 1920s, scientists realised that, for the first time, they had a detailed theory of how chemistry works. In principle, they could just set up these equations for different molecules, solve for the energy of the system, and figure out which molecules were stable and which reactions would happen spontaneously. But when they sat down to actually calculate the solutions to these equations, they found that they could do it exactly for the simplest atom (hydrogen) and virtually nothing else. Everything else was too complicated."

The state of a classical system can be described easily - we just have to track the position and momentum of each particle. Representing the state of a quantum system is far more challenging. A probability has to be assigned to every possible configuration of electron positions. This is encoded in the wavefunction, which assigns a positive or negative number to every configuration of electrons, and the wavefunction squared gives the probability of finding the system in that configuration. The space of all possible configurations is enormous - if you tried to represent it as a grid with 100 points along each dimension, then the number of possible electron configurations for the silicon atom would be larger than the number of atoms in the universe!"

In most quantum chemistry methods, antisymmetry is introduced using a function called the determinant. The determinant of a matrix has the property that if you swap two rows, the output gets multiplied by -1, just like a wavefunction for fermions. So you can take a bunch of single-electron functions, evaluate them for every electron in your system, and pack all of the results into one matrix. The determinant of that matrix is then a properly antisymmetric wavefunction. The major limitation of this approach is that the resulting function - known as a Slater determinant - is not very general. Wavefunctions of real systems are usually far more complicated. The typical way to improve on this is to take a large linear combination of Slater determinants - sometimes millions or more - and add some simple corrections based on pairs of electrons. Even then, this may not be enough to accurately compute energies."

To do that exactly, we would need to evaluate the wavefunction at all possible configurations of electrons, so we have to do it approximately instead. We pick a random selection of electron configurations, evaluate the energy locally at each arrangement of electrons, add up the contributions from each arrangement and minimise this instead of the true energy. This is known as a Monte Carlo method, because it\u2019s a bit like a gambler rolling dice over and over again. While it is approximate, if we need to make it more accurate we can always roll the dice again. Since the wavefunction squared gives the probability of observing an arrangement of particles in any location, it is most convenient to generate samples from the wavefunction itself - essentially, simulating the act of observing the particles. While most neural networks are trained from some external data, in our case the inputs used to train the neural network are generated by the neural network itself. It\u2019s a bit like pulling yourself up by your own bootstraps, and it means that we don\u2019t need any training data other than the positions of the atomic nuclei that the electrons are dancing around. The basic idea, known as variational quantum Monte Carlo (or VMC for short), has been around since the \u201860s, and it is generally considered a cheap but not very accurate way of computing the energy of a system. By replacing the simple wavefunctions based on Slater determinants with the FermiNet, we have dramatically increased the accuracy of this approach on every system we\u2019ve looked at."

These are small systems - 10 electrons or fewer - and simple enough that they can be treated by the most accurate (but exponential scaling) methods. The FermiNet outperforms comparable VMC calculations by a wide margin - often cutting the error relative to the exponentially-scaling calculations by half or more. On larger systems, the exponentially-scaling methods become intractable, so instead we use the \u201ccoupled cluster\u201d method as a baseline. This method works well on molecules in their stable configuration, but struggles when bonds get stretched or broken, which is critical for understanding chemical reactions. While it scales much better than exponentially, the particular coupled cluster method we used still scales as the number of electrons raised to the seventh power, so it can only be used for medium-sized molecules. We applied the FermiNet to progressively larger molecules, starting with lithium hydride and working our way up to bicyclobutane, the largest system we looked at, with 30 electrons. On the smallest molecules, the FermiNet captured an astounding 99.8% of the difference between the coupled cluster energy and the energy you get from a single Slater determinant. On bicyclobutane, the FermiNet still captured 97% or more of this correlation energy - a huge accomplishment for a supposedly \u201ccheap but inaccurate\u201d approach."
