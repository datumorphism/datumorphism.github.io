At the time, that demand was largely restricted to the San Francisco Bay Area and a few other coastal cities. Startups and tech firms in those areas seemed to want all the data scientists they could hire.

Because there wasn\u2019t yet a well-defined career path for people who could program with and analyze such data, data scientists had diverse educational backgrounds. The most common qualification in our informal survey of 35 data scientists at the time was a PhD in experimental physics, but we also found astronomers, psychologists, and meteorologists. Most had PhDs in some scientific field, were exceptional at math, and knew how to code. Given the absence of tools and processes at the time to perform their roles, they were also good at experimentation and invention. It\u2019s not that a science PhD was really required to do the work, but rather that these individuals had the rare ability to unlock the potential of data, wading through complex, messy data sets and building recommendation algorithms."

We expect to see continued differentiation of responsibilities and roles that all once fell under the data scientist category. Companies will need detailed skill classification and certification processes for these diverse jobs, and must ensure that all of the needed roles are present on large-scale data science projects. Professional data scientists themselves will focus on algorithmic innovation, but will also need to be responsible for ensuring that amateurs don\u2019t get in over their heads. Most importantly, data scientists must contribute towards appropriate collection of data, responsible analysis, fully-deployed models, and successful business outcomes."
