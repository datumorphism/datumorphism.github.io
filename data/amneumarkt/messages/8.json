Have they not achieved a union beyond what two separate minds can ever know, like Tristan and Isolde, the ill-fated couple in Richard Wagner\u2019s eponymous 1859 opera: \u201cUn-named, free from parting, new perception, new enkindling; ever endless self-knowing; warmly glowing heart, love\u2019s utmost joy!\u201d?

As well, we all know from our own bodies that the left and right hands often behave independently even though they are controlled by a single mind. (Imagine the difficulty of eating with a knife and fork if your hands couldn\u2019t operate independently of each other.) Thus, what seems to be the contradictory or the independent behaviour of each Bridged body should be seen as no different than the two hands that move separately. You can reach for a pencil with one hand and scratch an itch with the other; you can be conflicted about the moral thing to do with the voice of both the good and bad angel on the proverbial shoulder. In addition, initial work in primates and mice shows clear evidence that, once Bridged, the two brains learn as one mind. If a Bridged learns to play piano, and then is separated, neither of the separate individuals can play as well as the Bridged did. Where has the skill gone, if it does not remain in either person?"

Instead, a single consciousness comes into being, with its substrate extending across the two brains, experiencing the world through four eyes, four ears and so on."
