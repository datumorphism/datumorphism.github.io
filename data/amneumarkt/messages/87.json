In such a field, we will have a lot of apples-to-oranges comparisons with no correct answers. Suppose you were assigned a paper with a stronger evaluation, and a paper with a more original model: which one would you rank higher, and how much higher? How does either of these empirical papers compare to a theoretical work or a position paper?"

While this brings a lot of diversity, we have no way to test which changes are more successful: the organizers typically do some analysis, but each of them only has access to their own data, and they may not necessarily be asking the same questions. For example, ACL 2020 handled the increased reviewer load by forcing all authors to register as reviewers, and EMNLP 2020 - by requiring the senior authors to mentor junior reviewers. These two different recruitment strategies were accompanied by different review forms and policies. The end result is that we ran two very large-scale experiments with ourselves as the guinea pigs, but we do not really know what worked better and should be used next year. And even if there was such a conclusion, we have no mechanism to ensure that the more successful policy would be kept."

Can we help the area chairs to flag shallow, heuristic-based reviews, as well as the rude and one-liner reviews? When does that happen, and do certain types of papers get disproportionately affected? What kinds of tracks and review forms would improve the reviewer agreement and make the job easier for the chairs?
