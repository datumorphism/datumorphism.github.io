For example, he says, they adopt pet methods to tune their AIs' \"learning rates\"\u2014how much an algorithm corrects itself after each mistake\u2014without understanding why one is better than others. In other cases, AI researchers training their algorithms are simply stumbling in the dark. For example, they implement what's called \"stochastic gradient descent\" in order to optimize an algorithm's parameters for the lowest possible failure rate. Yet despite thousands of academic papers on the subject, and countless ways of applying the method, the process still relies on trial and error."

For starters, he says, researchers should conduct \"ablation studies\" like those done with the translation algorithm: deleting parts of an algorithm one at a time to see the function of each component. He calls for \"sliced analysis,\" in which an algorithm's performance is analyzed in detail to see how improvement in some areas might have a cost elsewhere. And he says researchers should test their algorithms with many different conditions and settings, and should report performances for all of them."

Some AI researchers are already taking that approach, testing image recognition algorithms on small black-and-white handwritten characters before tackling large color photos, to better understand the algorithms' inner mechanics."

At present, a paper is more likely to be published if the reported algorithm beats some benchmark than if the paper sheds light on the software's inner workings, he says. That's how the fancy translation algorithm made it through peer review. \"The purpose of science is to generate knowledge,\" he says. \"You want to produce something that other people can take and build on.\""
