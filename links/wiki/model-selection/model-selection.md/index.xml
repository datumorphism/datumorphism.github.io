Calculate the distance between data and model predictions. Apply Bayesian methods such as likelihood estimation: likelihood of observing the data if we assume the model; the results will be a set of fitting parameters. &amp;hellip; Why don&amp;rsquo;t we always use goodness-of-fit as a measure of the goodness of a model?
We may experience overfitting. The model may not be intuitive. This is why we would like to balance it with parsimony using some measures of generalizability.</description></item><item><title>Minimum Description Length</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/mdl/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/mdl/</guid><description>The minimum description length, aka, MDL, is based on the relations between regularity and data compression. (See Kolmogorov complexity Description of Data The measurement of complexity is based on the observation that the compressibility of data doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on the &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo; used to describe the compression process that much. This makes it possible for us to find a universal language, such as a universal computer language, to quantify the compressibility of the data.</description></item></channel></rss>
