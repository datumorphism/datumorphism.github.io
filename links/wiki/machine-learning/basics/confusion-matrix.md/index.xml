ROC Space. The color boxes are indicating the confusion matrices. Green is the fraction of true positive. Orange is the fraction of false positive. Refer to Confusion Matrix for more details.
AUC: Area under Curve TPR = TP Rate FPR = FP Rate The ROC curve is defined by the relation $f(TPR, FPR)$. Area under the ROC curve is
$$ \int TPR(FPR) d(FPR) \sim \sum_i TPR_i *\Delta FPR. $$
If AUC = 1, we have TP Rate = 1 for all FP Rate. This is the best performance a model could have.</description></item><item><title>Classifier Chains for Multilabel Classification</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/classification/classifier-chains/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/classification/classifier-chains/</guid><description>Multi-label problem In some classification problems, we have multilabel labels to be predicted. Many different approaches are proposed to solve such problems.
Algorithm Level Develop algorithms for multilabel problems, such as
Decision trees, AdaBoost. Problem Transformation On problem or data level, we can transform the multi-label problem to one or more single label problems.
Binary Relevance Method Binary relevance method, aka BM, transforms the problem into a single label problem by training a binary classifier for each label.
By doing so, the correlations between the target labels are lost.
Label Combination Method Label combination method (label power-set method), aka CM, combines the labels into single labels.</description></item></channel></rss>
