In short words, Boltzmann machine is a machine that has nodes that can take values, and the nodes are connected through some weight. It is just like any other neural nets but with complications and theoretical implications.
Boltzmann machine is usually used as a generative model.
Boltzmann Machine and Physics To obtain a good understanding of Boltzmann machine for a physicist, we begin with Ising model. We construct a system of neurons ${ s_i}$ which can take values of 1 or -1, where each pair of them $s_i$ and $s_j$ is connected by weight $J_{ij}$.</description></item></channel></rss>
