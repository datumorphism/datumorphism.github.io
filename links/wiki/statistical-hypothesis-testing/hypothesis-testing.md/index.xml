Why is Confidence Interval Needed? Suppose I sample the population multiple times, the mean value $\mu_i$ of the sample is calculated for each sample. It is a good question to ask how different these $\mu_i$ are compared to the true mean $\mu_p$ of the population.
In this article, we would need to specify several notations.</description></item><item><title>ANOVA</title><link>/wiki/statistics/anova/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/statistics/anova/</guid><description>In many problems, we have to test if the distributions of several groups are the same. We will use the null hypothesis:
The distributions of several groups are the same.
ANOVA tests the null hypothesis by comparing the variability between groups and within groups. If the variability between groups are significantly larger than the variability within groups, we are more confident that the distributions of different groups are different.
We will use two groups as an example.</description></item></channel></rss>
