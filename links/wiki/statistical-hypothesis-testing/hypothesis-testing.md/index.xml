Why is Confidence Interval Needed? Suppose I sample the population multiple times, the mean value $\mu_i$ of the sample is calculated for each sample. It is a good question to ask how different these $\mu_i$ are compared to the true mean $\mu_p$ of the population.
In this article, we would need to specify several notations.
$X$ is the quantity we are measuring. $\bar X$ is the mean of the quantity $X$. Confidence Interval This theorem states that the probability for the true mean $\mu_p$ to fall into a specific range can be calculated using</description></item><item><title>ANOVA</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/anova/</link><pubDate>Sun, 07 Mar 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/anova/</guid><description>In many problems, we have to test if several distributions associated with several groups of experiments are the same. The null hypothesis to be used is
The distributions of several groups are the same.
ANOVA tests the null hypothesis by comparing the variability between groups and within groups. If the variability between groups are significantly larger than the variability within groups, we are more confident that the distributions of different groups are different.
We will use two-group experiments as an example. We use a fake dataset:
Group A $x^A_1$ $x^A_2$ &amp;hellip; $x^A_{N_A}$ Group B $x^B_1$ $x^B_2$ &amp;hellip; $x^B_{N_B}$ Within Group Variability The within group variability is proportional to</description></item></channel></rss>
