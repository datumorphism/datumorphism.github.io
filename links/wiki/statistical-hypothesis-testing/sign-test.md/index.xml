Of course, the population mean $\mu_p$ is unknown and probably can never be known.
This specific sample mean $\mu_0$ is nothing but like an advanced educated guess. Then again, how do we know if our this specific sample mean $\mu_0$ is a faithful representation of the population mean? In fact, this question is not limited to mean. It applies to any statistical measurement.
The Statistical Estimation Theory Solution to This Problem
In statistical estimation theory, we would tell the sample value with some indication of the degrees of faithfulness.</description></item></channel></rss>
