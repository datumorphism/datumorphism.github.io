In this article, we perform an association rule analysis of some demo data.
The Problem Defined Suppose we own a store called KIOSK. Here at KIOSK, we sell 4 different things.
Milk Croissant Coffee Fries We need to know what items are associated with each other when the customers are buying.
We have collected the following data. Beware that this small amount of data might not be enough for a real-world problem.</description></item><item><title>Correlation Coefficient and Covariance for Numeric Data</title><link>/wiki/statistics/correlation-coefficient/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/statistics/correlation-coefficient/</guid><description>Covariances Correlation coefficient is also known as the Pearson&amp;rsquo;s product moment coefficient. Review of Standard Deviation For a series of data A, we have the standard deviations
$$ \sigma_A = \sqrt{ \frac{ \sum (a_i - \bar A)^2 }{ n } }, $$
where $n$ is the number of elements in series A.
The standard deviation is very easy to understand. It is basically the average Eucleadian distance between the data points and the average value.</description></item></channel></rss>
