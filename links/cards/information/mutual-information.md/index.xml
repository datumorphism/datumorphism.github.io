Contrastive use special objective functions such as [[NCE]] Noise Contrastive Estimation: NCE Noise contrastive estimation (NCE) objective function is1 $$ \mathcal L = \mathbb E_{x, x^{+}, x^{-}} \left[ - \ln \frac{ C(x, x^{+})}{ C(x,x^{+}) + C(x,x^{-}) } \right], $$ where $x^{+}$ represents data similar to $x$, $x^{-}$ represents data dissimilar to $x$, $C(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a function to compute the similarities. For example, we can use $$ C(x, x^{+}) = e^{ f(x)^T f(x^{+}) }, $$ so that the objective function becomes $$ \mathcal L = \mathbb E_{x, x^{+}, x^{-}} \left[ - \ln \frac{ e^{ … and [[Mutual Information]] Mutual Information Mutual information is defined as $$ I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p_{XY}} \ln \frac{P_{XY}}{P_X P_Y}.</description></item><item><title>Contrastive Model: Context-Instance</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/context-instance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/context-instance/</guid><description>In contrastive methods, we can manipulate the data to create data entries and infer the changes using a model. These methods are models that &amp;ldquo;predict relative position&amp;rdquo;1. Common tricks are
shuffling image sections like jigsaw, and rotate the image. We can also adjust the model to discriminate the similarities and differences. For example, to generate contrast, we can also use [[Mutual Information]] Mutual Information Mutual information is defined as $$ I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p_{XY}} \ln \frac{P_{XY}}{P_X P_Y}. $$ In the case that $X$ and $Y$ are independent variables, we have $P_{XY} = P_X P_Y$, thus $I(X;Y) = 0$.</description></item><item><title>infoGAN</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/adversarial-models/infogan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/adversarial-models/infogan/</guid><description>In GAN, the latent space input is usually random noise, e.g., Gaussian noise. The objective of [[GAN]] GAN The task of GAN is to generate features $X$ from some noise $\xi$ and class labels $Y$, $$\xi, Y \to X.$$ Many different GANs are proposed. Vanilla GAN has a simple structure with a single discriminator and a single generator. It uses the minmax game setup. However, it is not stable to use minmax game to train a GAN model. WassersteinGAN was proposed to solve the stability problem during training1. More advanced GANs like BiGAN and ALI have more complex structures. Vanilla GAN Minmax Game … is a very generic one.</description></item><item><title>Deep Infomax</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/deep-infomax/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/deep-infomax/</guid><description>Max Global Mutual Information
Why not just use the global mutual information of the input and encoder output as the objective?
&amp;hellip; maximizing MI between the complete input and the encoder output (i.e.,globalMI) is ofteninsufficient for learning useful representations.

[[Mutual information]] Mutual Information Mutual information is defined as $$ I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p_{XY}} \ln \frac{P_{XY}}{P_X P_Y}. $$ In the case that $X$ and $Y$ are independent variables, we have $P_{XY} = P_X P_Y$, thus $I(X;Y) = 0$. This makes sense as there would be no &amp;ldquo;mutual&amp;rdquo; information if the two variables are independent of each other.</description></item></channel></rss>
