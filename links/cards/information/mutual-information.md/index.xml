Contrastive use special objective functions such as NCE Noise Contrastive Estimation: NCE Noise contrastive estimation (NCE) objective function is1 $$ \mathcal L = \mathbb E_{x, x^{+}, x^{-}} \left[ - \ln \frac{ C(x, x^{+})}{ C(x,x^{+}) + C(x,x^{-}) } \right], $$ where $x^{+}$ represents data similar to $x$, $x^{-}$ represents data dissimilar to $x$, $C(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a function to compute the similarities. For example, we can use $$ C(x, x^{+}) = e^{ f(x)^T f(x^{+}) }, $$ so that the objective function becomes $$ \mathcal L = \mathbb E_{x, x^{+}, x^{-}} \left[ - \ln \frac{ e^{ â€¦ and Mutual Information Mutual Information Mutual information is defined as $$ I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p_{XY}} \ln \frac{P_{XY}}{P_X P_Y}.</description></item><item><title>Contrastive Model: Context-Instance</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/context-instance/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/contrastive-models/context-instance/</guid><description>In contrastive methods, we can manipulate the data to create data entries and infer the changes using a model. These methods are models that &amp;ldquo;predict relative position&amp;rdquo;1. Common tricks are
shuffling image sections like jigsaw, and rotate the image. We can also adjust the model to discriminate the similarities and differences. For example, to generate contrast, we can also use Mutual Information Mutual Information Mutual information is defined as $$ I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p_{XY}} \ln \frac{P_{XY}}{P_X P_Y}. $$ In the case that $X$ and $Y$ are independent variables, we have $P_{XY} = P_X P_Y$, thus $I(X;Y) = 0$.</description></item><item><title>infoGAN</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/adversarial-models/infogan/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/adversarial-models/infogan/</guid><description>In GAN, the latent space input is usually random noise, e.g., Gaussian noise. The objective of GAN is a very generic one. It doesn&amp;rsquo;t say anything about how exactly the latent space will be used. This is not desirable in many problems. We would like to have more interpretability in the latent space. InfoGAN introduced constraints to the objective to enforce interpretability of the latent space1.
Constraint The constraint InfoGAN proposed is Mutual Information Mutual Information Mutual information is defined as $$ I(X;Y) = \mathbb E_{p_{XY}} \ln \frac{P_{XY}}{P_X P_Y}. $$ In the case that $X$ and $Y$ are independent variables, we have $P_{XY} = P_X P_Y$, thus $I(X;Y) = 0$.</description></item></channel></rss>
