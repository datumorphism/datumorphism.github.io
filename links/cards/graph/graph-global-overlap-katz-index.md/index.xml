Node Centrality Importance of a node on a graph:
Eigenvector Centrality of a Graph Given a graph with adjacency matrix $\mathbf A$, the eigenvector centrality is $$ \mathbf e_u = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{v\in\mathcal V} \mathbf A[u,v] \mathbf e_v, \qquad \forall u \in \mathcal V. $$ Why is it called Eigenvector Centrality The definition is equivalent to $$ \lambda \mathbf e = \mathbf A\mathbf e. $$ Power Iteration The solution to $\mathbf e$ is the eigenvector that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$.</description></item><item><title>Graph Global Overlap Measure: Leicht-Holme-Newman Index</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-leicht-holme-newman-similarity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-leicht-holme-newman-similarity/</guid><description>From Katz Index to LHN Index Katz Index Graph Global Overlap Measure: Katz Index The Katz index is $$ \mathbf S_{\text{Katz}}[u,v] = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta^i \mathbf A^i[u, v], $$ where $\mathbf A^i[u, v]$ is the matrix $\mathbf A$ to the $i$th power. Some for $\beta^i$. The Katz index describes the similarity between of node $u$ and node $v$. Do not confuse power with contravariant indices For readers familiar with tensor notations, it might be confusing. We some times use contravariant indices on the top right of the tensor notation. But here ${}^{i}$ means to the $i$th â€¦ has a knob to tune the punishment towards longer paths.</description></item></channel></rss>
