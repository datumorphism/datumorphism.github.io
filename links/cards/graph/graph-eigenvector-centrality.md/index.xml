Eigenvector Centrality of a Graph Given a graph with adjacency matrix $\mathbf A$, the eigenvector centrality is $$ \mathbf e_u = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{v\in\mathcal V} \mathbf A[u,v] \mathbf e_v, \qquad \forall u \in \mathcal V. $$ Why is it called Eigenvector Centrality The definition is equivalent to $$ \lambda \mathbf e = \mathbf A\mathbf e. $$ Power Iteration The solution to $\mathbf e$ is the eigenvector that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$.</description></item><item><title>Graph Global Overlap Measure: Random Walk Similarity</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-random-walk-similarity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-random-walk-similarity/</guid><description>Random Walk Construct a stochastic transfer matrix $P$ by normalizing the adjacency matrix $\mathbf A$ using the node degrees of the target nodes,

where $\mathbf A$ is the adjacency matrix Graph Adjacency Matrix A graph $\mathcal G$ can be represented with an adjacency matrix $\mathbf A$. Multiplication of Adjacency Matrices Multiplication of adjacency matrices tells us about the path between nodes. $A[u,v]$ is the length-1 path between node $u$ and $v$. If $A[u,v]=0$, there is no path. If $A[u,v]=1$, we have a length-1 path. For $A^2[u,v]$, we have $$ A^2_{uv} = \sum_k A_{uk}A_{kv}.</description></item></channel></rss>
