All the node attributes put together can be written as a list $\mathbf f\to (f_{v_1}, f_{v_2}, \cdots, f_{v_N})$.
Convolution on graph is combining attributes on nodes with their neighbors'. The [[adjacency matrix]] Graph Adjacency Matrix A graph $\mathcal G$ can be represented with an adjacency matrix $\mathbf A$. There are some nice and clear examples on wikipedia1, for example, $$ \begin{pmatrix} 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\ 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 1\\ 1 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0\\ 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{pmatrix} $$ for the graph Public Domain, Link $\mathbf A$ applied on all node attributes $\mathbf f$ is such an operation, i.</description></item><item><title>Graph Global Overlap Measure: Katz Index</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-katz-index/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-katz-index/</guid><description>The Katz index is
$$ \mathbf S_{\text{Katz}}[u,v] = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta^i \mathbf A^i[u, v], $$
where $\mathbf A^i[u, v]$ is the matrix $\mathbf A$ to the $i$th power. Some for $\beta^i$. The Katz index describes the similarity between of node $u$ and node $v$.
Do not confuse power with contravariant indices
For readers familiar with tensor notations, it might be confusing. We some times use contravariant indices on the top right of the tensor notation.
But here ${}^{i}$ means to the $i$th power.
The index is proved to be the following
$$ \mathbf S_{\text{Katz}} = (\mathbf I - \beta \mathbf A)^{-1} - \mathbf I.</description></item><item><title>Graph Global Overlap Measure: Leicht-Holme-Newman Index</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-leicht-holme-newman-similarity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-leicht-holme-newman-similarity/</guid><description>From Katz Index to LHN Index [[Katz Index]] Graph Global Overlap Measure: Katz Index The Katz index is $$ \mathbf S_{\text{Katz}}[u,v] = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta^i \mathbf A^i[u, v], $$ where $\mathbf A^i[u, v]$ is the matrix $\mathbf A$ to the $i$th power.
