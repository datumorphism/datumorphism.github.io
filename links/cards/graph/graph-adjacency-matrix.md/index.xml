$$ \mathbf S_{\text{Katz}}[u,v] = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta^i \mathbf A^i[u, v], $$
where $\mathbf A^i[u, v]$ is the matrix $\mathbf A$ to the $i$th power. Some for $\beta^i$. The Katz index describes the similarity between of node $u$ and node $v$.
Do not confuse power with contravariant indices
For readers familiar with tensor notations, it might be confusing. We some times use contravariant indices on the top right of the tensor notation.
But here ${}^{i}$ means to the $i$th power.
The index is proved to be the following
$$ \mathbf S_{\text{Katz}} = (\mathbf I - \beta \mathbf A)^{-1} - \mathbf I.</description></item><item><title>Graph Global Overlap Measure: Leicht-Holme-Newman Index</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-leicht-holme-newman-similarity/</link><pubDate>Sun, 26 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-global-overlap-leicht-holme-newman-similarity/</guid><description>From Katz Index to LHN Index Katz Index Graph Global Overlap Measure: Katz Index The Katz index is $$ \mathbf S_{\text{Katz}}[u,v] = \sum_{i=1}^\infty \beta^i \mathbf A^i[u, v], $$ where $\mathbf A^i[u, v]$ is the matrix $\mathbf A$ to the $i$th power.

Multiplication of Adjacency Matrices Multiplication of adjacency matrices tells us about the path between nodes. $A[u,v]$ is the length-1 path between node $u$ and $v$. If $A[u,v]=0$, there is no path. If $A[u,v]=1$, we have a length-1 path. For $A^2[u,v]$, we have $$ A^2_{uv} = \sum_k A_{uk}A_{kv}.</description></item><item><title>Graph Laplacians</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-laplacians/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-laplacians/</guid><description>Laplacian is a useful representation of graphs.
