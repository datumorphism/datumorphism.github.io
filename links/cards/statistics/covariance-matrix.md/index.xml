Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is a commonly used trick for dimensionality reduction so that the new features represents most of the variances of the data.
Representations of Dataset In theory, a dataset can be represented by a matrix if we specify the basis. However, the initial given basis is not always the most convinient one. Suppose we find a new set of basis for the dataset, the matrix representation may be simpler and easier to use.
For convenience, we do not distinguish the representation and the abstract dataset in this article.</description></item><item><title>Correlation Coefficient and Covariance for Numeric Data</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/correlation-coefficient/</link><pubDate>Sun, 18 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistics/correlation-coefficient/</guid><description>Covariances Correlation coefficient is also known as the Pearson&amp;rsquo;s product moment coefficient. Review of Standard Deviation For a series of data A, we have the standard deviations
$$ \sigma_A = \sqrt{ \frac{ \sum (a_i - \bar A)^2 }{ n } }, $$
where $n$ is the number of elements in series A.
The standard deviation is very easy to understand. It is basically the average Eucleadian distance between the data points and the average value. In this article, we will take another point of view.
Now imagine we have two series $(a_i - \bar A)$ and $(a_j - \bar A)$. The geometric mean squared for $i=j$ is</description></item></channel></rss>
