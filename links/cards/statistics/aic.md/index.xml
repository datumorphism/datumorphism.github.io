$$ \mathrm{BIC} = -2\ln p(y|\hat\theta) + k\ln n = \ln \left(\frac{n^k}{p^2}\right) $$
$n$ is the observations. We prefer the model with a small BIC.</description></item><item><title>Model Comparison</title><link>/wiki/model-selection/model-selection/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/model-selection/model-selection/</guid><description>The parsimony model comes from the idea of Occam&amp;rsquo;s razor: We choose the simple model that has more explanatory power.
The instance theory is a good model to explain the lexical decision task but it is not the only one. However, it simply makes it popular.
What is a Good Model? A good model should be presumably
plausibility balance of parsimony and goodness-of-fit coherence of the underlying assumptions easy to understand when it breaks down consistency with known results especially with the simple and basic phenomena ability to explain rather than describe data extent to which model predictions can be falsified through experiments.</description></item></channel></rss>
