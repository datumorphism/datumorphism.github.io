Based on a data sample, we could reconstruct some sort of theoretical models to represent the actual generating process.
Which is a Good Model? (1)The black curve represent the generating process. The red rectangle is a very simple model that captures some major samples. The blue step-wise model is capturing more sample data but with more parameters.
In the above example, the red model on the left is not that good in most cases while the blue model seems to be better. In reality, the choice depends on the usage of the model.</description></item><item><title>Bayesian Information Criterion</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/bic/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/bic/</guid><description>BIC is Bayesian information criterion, it replaced the $+2k$ term in [[AIC]] Akaike Information Criterion Suppose we have a model that describes the data generation process behind a dataset. The distribution by the model is denoted as $\hat f$. The actual data generation process is described by a distribution $f$. We ask the question: How good is the approximation using $\hat f$? To be more precise, how much information is lost if we use our model dist $\hat f$ to substitute the actual data generation distribution $f$? AIC defines this information loss as $$ \mathrm{AIC} = - 2 \ln p(y|\hat\theta) + â€¦ with $k\ln n$ to bring in punishment for the number of parameters of the model based on the number of data records,</description></item></channel></rss>
