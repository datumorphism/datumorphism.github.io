Based on a data sample, we could reconstruct some sort of theoretical models to represent the actual generating process.
Which is a Good Model? (1)The black curve represent the generating process. The red rectangle is a very simple model that captures some major samples. The blue step-wise model is capturing more sample data but with more parameters.
In the above example, the red model on the left is not that good in most cases while the blue model seems to be better. In reality, the choice depends on the usage of the model.</description></item></channel></rss>
