Based on a data sample, we could reconstruct some sort of theoretical models to represent the actual generating process.
Which is a Good Model? (1)The black curve represent the generating process. The red rectangle is a very simple model that captures some major samples. The blue step-wise model is capturing more sample data but with more parameters.</description></item><item><title>MDL and Neural Networks</title><link>/wiki/model-selection/mdl-and-neural-networks/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/wiki/model-selection/mdl-and-neural-networks/</guid><description>Minimum Description Length ( MDL MDL is a measure of how well a model compresses data by minimizing the combined cost of the description of the model and the misfit. ) can be used to construct a concise network. A fully connected network has great expressing power but it is easily overfitting.
One strategy is to apply constraints to the networks:
Limit the connections; Shared weights in subgroups of the network; Constrain the weights using some probability distributions.</description></item><item><title>Fisher Information Approximation</title><link>/cards/statistics/fia/</link><pubDate>Sun, 08 Nov 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/cards/statistics/fia/</guid><description>FIA is a method to describe the minimum description length ( MDL MDL is a measure of how well a model compresses data by minimizing the combined cost of the description of the model and the misfit. ) of models,

The measurement of complexity is based on the observation that the compressibility of data doesn&amp;rsquo;t depend on the &amp;ldquo;language&amp;rdquo; used to describe the compression process that much. This makes it possible for us to find a universal language, such as a universal computer language, to quantify the compressibility of the data.
One intuitive idea is to use a programming language to describe the data. If we have a sequence of data,</description></item></channel></rss>
