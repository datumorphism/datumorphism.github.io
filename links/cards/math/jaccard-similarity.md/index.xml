Node Centrality Importance of a node on a graph:
Eigenvector Centrality of a Graph Given a graph with adjacency matrix $\mathbf A$, the eigenvector centrality is $$ \mathbf e_u = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{v\in\mathcal V} \mathbf A[u,v] \mathbf e_v, \qquad \forall u \in \mathcal V. $$ Why is it called Eigenvector Centrality The definition is equivalent to $$ \lambda \mathbf e = \mathbf A\mathbf e. $$ Power Iteration The solution to $\mathbf e$ is the eigenvector that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$.</description></item><item><title>Cosine Similarity</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/math/cosine-similarity/</link><pubDate>Mon, 06 May 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/math/cosine-similarity/</guid><description>As simple as the inner product of two vectors
$$ d_{cos} = \frac{\vec A}{\vert \vec A \vert} \cdot \frac{\vec B }{ \vert \vec B \vert} $$
Examples To use cosine similarity, we have to vectorize the words first. There are many different methods to achieve this. For the purpose of illustrating cosine similarity, we use term frequency.
Term frequency is the occurrence of the words. We do not deal with duplications so duplicate words will have some effect on the similarity.
In principle, we could also use word set for a sentence to remove the effect of duplicate words. In most cases, if a word is repeating, it would indeed make the sentences different.</description></item></channel></rss>
