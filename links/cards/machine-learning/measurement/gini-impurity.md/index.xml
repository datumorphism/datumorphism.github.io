The code used in this article can be found in this repo. Definition of the problem We will decide whether one should go to work today. In this demo project, we consider the following features.
feature possible values health 0: feeling bad, 1: feeling good weather 0: bad weather, 1: good weather holiday 1: holiday, 0: not holiday For more compact notations, we use the abstract notation $\{0,1\}^3$ to describe a set of three features each with 0 and 1 as possible values. In general, the notation $\{0,1\}^d$ indicates $d$ binary features.</description></item><item><title>Random Forest</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/tree-based/random-forest/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/machine-learning/tree-based/random-forest/</guid><description>Random forest is an ensemble method based on decision trees. Instead of using one decision tree and model on all the features, the decision tree method can model on a random set of features (feature subspace) using many decision trees and make decisions by democratizing the trees.
Given a proper dataset $\mathscr D(\mathbf X, \mathbf y)$, the ensemble of trees is denoted as ${f_i(\mathbf X)}$, will predict an ensemble of results. There are several key ideas in random forests.
Are the predicted results representative? How to democratize the ensemble of results? What determines the quality of the predictions? Margin, Strength, and Correlations The margin of the model, the strength of the trees, and the correlation between the trees are crucial to answer the questions.</description></item><item><title>Information Gain</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/measurement/information-gain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/measurement/information-gain/</guid><description>Information gain is a frequently used metric in calculating the gain during a split in tree-based methods.
First o all, the entropy of a dataset if defined as
$$ S = - sum_i p_i \log p_i - sum_i (1-p_i)\log p_i, $$
where $p_i$ is the probability of a class.
The information gain is the difference between the entropy.
For example, in a decision tree algorithm, we would split a node. Before splitting, we assign a label $m$ to the node,
$$ S_m = - p_m \log p_m - (1-p_m)\log p_m. $$
After the splitting, we have two groups that contributes to the entropy, group $L$ and group $R$,</description></item></channel></rss>
