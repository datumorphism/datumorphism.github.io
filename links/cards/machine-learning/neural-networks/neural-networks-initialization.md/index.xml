A safe but time wasting option is to use search on a grid of parameters. However, there are smarter moves.
Karpathyâ€™s Constant
An empirical learning rate $3^{-4}$ for Adms, aka, Karpathy's constant, was started as a tweet by Andrei Karpathy. 3e-4 is the best learning rate for Adam, hands down.

&amp;mdash; Andrej Karpathy (@karpathy) November 24, 2016 Smarter Method A smarter method is to start with small learning rate and increase it on each mini-batch, then observe the loss vs learning rate (mini-batch in this case).</description></item><item><title>PyTorch: Initialize Parameters</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/til/machine-learning/pytorch/pytorch-initial-params/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/til/machine-learning/pytorch/pytorch-initial-params/</guid><description>We can set the parameters in a for loop. We take some of the initialization methods from Lippe1.
To set based on the input dimension of the layer ( [[Initialize Artificial Neural Networks]] Initialize Artificial Neural Networks Initialize a neural network is important for the training and performance. Some initializations simply don&amp;#39;t work, some will degrade the performance of the model. We should choose wisely. ) (normalized initialization),
