Ultimately, we need to find an approximation $g$ of the true map $f$ from features $\mathcal X$ to targets $\mathcal Y$ on a specific probability distribution of features $P$. This process is done by using an algorithm to select some hypothesis that works.
From the book Learning From Data by Abu-Mostafa, Magdon-Ismail, and Lin. I am using a version by Deckert.
In the core of machine learning models, we have three components3:
Representation: encode data and problem representation, i.e., propose a space to set a stage.</description></item><item><title>Cross Validation</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/learning-theories/cross-validation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/learning-theories/cross-validation/</guid><description>Cross validation is a method to estimate the [[risk]] The Learning Problem The learning problem posed by Vapnik:1 Given a sample: $\{z_i\}$ in the probability space $Z$; Assuming a probability measure on the probability space $Z$; Assuming a set of functions $Q(z, \alpha)$ (e.g. loss functions), where $\alpha$ is a set of parameters; A risk functional to be minimized by tunning &amp;ldquo;the handles&amp;rdquo; $\alpha$, $R(\alpha)$.
