$$ \begin{equation} Y = f(X) + \epsilon. \label{dataset-using-true-model} \end{equation} $$
On the other hand, we build another model using a specific method such as k-nearest neighbors, which is denoted as $k(X)$.
Why the two models?
Why are we talking about the perfect model and a model using a specific method?
The perfect model $f(X)$ is our ultimate goal, while the model using a specific method $k(X)$ is our effort of approaching the ultimate model.
The bias measures the deficit between $k(X)$ and the perfect model $f(X)$,</description></item><item><title>The Learning Problem</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/learning-theories/learning-problem/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/learning-theories/learning-problem/</guid><description>The learning problem proposed by Vapnik:1
