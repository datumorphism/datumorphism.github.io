$$ c(v) = \sum_{v\neq u_s\neq u_t} \frac{\sigma_{u_su_t}(v) }{\sigma_{u_su_t}}, $$
where $\sigma_{u_su_t}(v)$ is the number of shortest path between $u_s$ and $u_t$, and passing through $u$, while $\sigma_{u_su_t}$ is the number of shortest path between $u_s$ and $u_t$.
A figure from wikipedia demonstrates this idea well.</description></item><item><title>Eigenvector Centrality of a Graph</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-eigenvector-centrality/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/graph-eigenvector-centrality/</guid><description>Given a graph with adjacency matrix $\mathbf A$, the eigenvector centrality is
$$ \mathbf e_u = \frac{1}{\lambda} \sum_{v\in\mathcal V} \mathbf A[u,v] \mathbf e_v, \qquad \forall u \in \mathcal V. $$
Why is it called Eigenvector Centrality
The definition is equivalent to
$$ \lambda \mathbf e = \mathbf A\mathbf e. $$
Power Iteration The solution to $\mathbf e$ is the eigenvector that corresponds to the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_1$. Power iteration method can help us get this eigenvector, i.</description></item><item><title>Heterophily on Graph</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/heterophily/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/heterophily/</guid><description>Heterophily is the tendency to differ from others. Heterophily on a graph is the tendency to connect to nodes that are different from itself, e.g., nodes with different attributes have higher probability of edge.</description></item><item><title>Homophily on Graph</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/homophily/</link><pubDate>Sat, 25 Sep 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/graph/homophily/</guid><description> Homophily is the principle that a contact between similar people occurs at ahigher rate than among dissimilar people &amp;ndash; McPherson20011
