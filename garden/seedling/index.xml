Neyman-Pearson Lemma The Neyman-Pearson Lemma is an very intuitive lemma to understand how to choose a hypothesis. The lecture notes from PennState is a very good read on this topic1.
An example For simplicity, we assume that there exists a test statistic $T$ and $T$ can be used to measure how likely the hypothesis $H$ is true, e.g., the hypothesis $H$ is false, corresponds to $T$ being small.
The reference from Shafer2007 assumes a random variable $T$ to be large if the hypothesis $H$ is false[^Shafer2007]. One example is the ratio of likelihood2,</description></item><item><title>Multiple Comparison Problem</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/multiple-comparison-problem/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/statistics/multiple-comparison-problem/</guid><description>In a multiple comparisons problem, we deal with multiple statistical tests simultaneously.
Examples We see such problems a lot in IT companies. Suppose we have a website and would like to test if a new design of a button can lead to some changes in five different KPIs (e.g., view-to-click rate, click-to-book rate, &amp;hellip;).
In multi-horizon time series forecasting, we sometimes choose to forecast multiple future data points in one shot. To properly find the confidence intervals of our predictions, one approach is the so called conformal prediction method. This becomes a multiple comparisons problem because we have to tell if we can reject at least one true null hypothesis.</description></item></channel></rss>
