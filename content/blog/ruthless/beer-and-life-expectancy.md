**This is a post of no analysis at all. Everything in this post is meant for fun.**

I moved to Germany a few weeks ago and one of the most astonishing things I noticed is that everyone is drinking so much. Yet the life expectance of Germany is pretty high. So I performed this "analysis" for fun.

As you might be curious about the life expectancy vs the life expectancy, I also made one plot about it.
