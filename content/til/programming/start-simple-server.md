Sometimes we debug html locally but run into the error

> XMLHttpRequest cannot load file:///xxx/xxx/xxxx.html. Cross origin requests are only supported for protocol schemes: http, data, chrome, chrome-extension, https, chrome-extension-resource.


The solution is to run a very simple static web server locally by using a python one-liner

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000
```
