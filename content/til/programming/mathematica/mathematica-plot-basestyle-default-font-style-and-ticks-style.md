Most of the time, the plot generated using Mathematica is not a good one for projectors because the font size and ticks size are small. `BaseStyle` is a good solution to this problem. Here is an example from Wolfram Language

```
Plot[Sin[x]^2, {x, 0, 2 Pi}, PlotLabel -> Sin[x]^2, LabelStyle -> Black, FrameTicksStyle -> Larger, BaseStyle -> \
{FontWeight -> "Bold", FontSize -> 18}]
```

As shown in the example, `LabelStyle->Black` and `FrameTicksStyle->Larger` are also very useful when producing slides for projectors.
