`pathlib` is object oriented. It is more elegant than `os.path`. For example, if we need the parent folders of the currrent file, we need `os.path.dirname()`,

```python
import os

print(f"file: {__file__}")
# file: main.py

# Using os.path
os__file_absolute_path = os.path.abspath(__file__)
print(f"Using os.path:: file absolute path: {os__file_absolute_path}")
# Using os.path:: file absolute path: /home/runner/pathlib/main.py

os__file_in_folder = os.path.dirname(os__file_absolute_path)
print(f"Using os.path:: file is in folder: {os__file_in_folder}")
# Using os.path:: file is in folder: /home/runner/pathlib
```

It is much more easier to get the folder using `pathlib`.

```python
from pathlib import Path

print(f"file: {__file__}")
# file: main.py

# Using pathlib
path__file = Path(__file__)
print(f"Using pathlib:: path__file: {path__file}; using .resolve method: {path__file.resolve()}")
# Using pathlib:: path__file: main.py; using .resolve method: /home/runner/pathlib/main.py

path__file_in_folder = path__file.resolve().parent
print(f"Using pathlib:: path__file_in_folder: {path__file_in_folder}")
# Using pathlib:: path__file_in_folder: /home/runner/pathlib
```


`pathlib` also [supports](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html#basic-use) [glob](https://docs.python.org/3/library/glob.html).
