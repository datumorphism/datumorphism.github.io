Datumorphism is my notebook about machine learning, programming, data, statistics, and data visualization. Most of the topics are here because I need them in my work or personal projects.

To organize the notes more elegantly, I created a [hugo](https://gohugo.io/) theme called [connectome](https://github.com/kausalflow/connectome) to host them. The essence of the theme is to enable bi-directional connections between them.

This website is mostly designed to be a reference book for myself.
