The conditional probability table, aka CPT, is used to calculate conditional probabilities from a dataset.

Given a dataset with features $\mathbf X$ and their corresponding classes $\mathbf Y$, the conditional probabilities of each class given a certain feature value can be calculated using a CPT which in turn can be calculated using a {{<c "/wiki/statistics/correlation-coefficient.md" "contigency table" >}}.
