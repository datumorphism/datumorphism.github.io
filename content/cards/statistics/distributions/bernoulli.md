Two categories with probability $p$ and $1-p$ respectively.

For each experiment, the sample space is $\\{A, B\\}$. The probability for state $A$ is given by $p$ and the probability for state $B$ is given by $1-p$. The Bernoulli distribution describes the probability of $K$ results with state $s$ being $s=A$ and $N-K$ results with state $s$ being $B$ after $N$ experiments,
