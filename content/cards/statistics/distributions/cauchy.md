## Cauchy-Lorentz Distribution

> .. ratio of two independent normally distributed random variables with mean zero.

> Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cauchy_distribution

Lorentz distribution is frequently used in physics.

PDF:

$$
\frac{1}{\pi\gamma} \left( \frac{\gamma^2}{ (x-x_0)^2 + \gamma^2} \right)
$$

The median and mode of the Cauchy-Lorentz distribution is always $x_0$. $\gamma$ is the FWHM.
