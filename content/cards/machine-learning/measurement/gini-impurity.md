Suppose we have a dataset $\\{0,1\\}^{10}$, which has 10 records and 2 possible classes of objects $\\{0,1\\}$ in each record.

The first example we investigate is a pure 0 dataset.

| object |
|:---:|
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 0 |

For such an all-0 dataset, we would like to define its impurity as 0. Same with an all-1 dataset. For a dataset with 50% of 1 and 50% of 0, we would define its impurity as max due to the symmetries between 0 and 1.

## Definition

Given a dataset $\\{0,1,...,d\\}^n$, the Gini impurity is calculated as

{{< m >}}
G = \sum_{i \in \{0,1,...,d\} } p(i)(1-p(i)),
{{</m >}}

where $p(i)$ is the probability of a random picked record being class $i$.

In the above example, we have two classes, $\\{0,1\\}$. The probabilities are

{{< m >}}
\begin{align}
p(0) =& 1\\
p(1) =& 0
\end{align}.
{{< /m >}}

The Gini impurity is

{{< m >}}
G = p(0)(1-p(0)) + p(1)(1-p(1)) = 0+0 = 0.
{{< /m >}}

## Examples

Suppose we have another dataset with 50% of the values being 50%.

| object |
|:---:|
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 1 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 1 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 0 |
| 1 |

The Gini impurity is

{{< m >}}
G = p(0)(1-p(0)) + p(1)(1-p(1)) = 0.5 * 0.5+ 0.5*0.5 = 0.5.
{{< /m >}}

For data with two possible values $\\{0,1\\}$, the maximum Gini impurity is 0.25. The following chart shows all the possible values of the Gini impurity for two-value dataset.

For data with three possible values, the Gini impurity is also visualized using the same chart given the condition that $p_3 = 1 - p_1 - p_2$.
