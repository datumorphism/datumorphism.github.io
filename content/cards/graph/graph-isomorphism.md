For two graphs, $\mathcal G$ and $\mathcal H$, the two graphs are isomorphism on the following condition

{{< m >}}
u, v \text{ adjacent in } G \iff u, v \text{ adjacent in } H.
{{< /m >}}

An algorithm to find approximate isomorphism is the {{< c "cards/graph/graph-weisfeiler-lehman-kernel.md" "Weisfeiler Lehman Method" >}}.
