The Continuous Ranked Probability Score, known as CRPS, is a score to measure how a proposed distribution approximates the data, without assuming the distributions of the data.


## Definition

CRPS is defined as[^Hersbach2000]

{{< m >}}
CRPS(P, x_a) = \int_{-\infty}^\infty  \lVert P(x) - H(x - x_a) \rVert_2 dx,
{{< /m >}}

where

- $x_a$ is the true value of $x$,
- P(x) is our proposed cumulative distribution for $x$,
- $H(x)$ is the Heaviside step function
  {{< m >}}
  H(x) = \begin{cases}
  1, &\qquad x=0\\
  0, &\qquad x\leq 0\\
  \end{cases}
  {{< /m >}}
- $\lVert \cdot \rVert_2$ is the L2 norm.


## Explain it


The formula looks abstract on first sight, but it becomes crystal clear once we understand it.


Note that the distributions that corresponds to a Heaviside CDF is the delta function $\delta(x-x_a)$. What this score is calculating is the difference between our distribution and a delta function. If we have a model that minimizes CRPS, then we are looking for a distribution that is close to the delta function $\delta(x-x_a)$. In other words, we want our distribution to be large around $x_a$.

To illustrate what the integrand $\lVert P(x) - H(x - x_a) \rVert_2$ means, we consider several scenarios.

The shade areas determines the integrand of the integral in CRPS. The only way to get a small score is to choose a distribution that is focused around $x_a$.

## Compared to f-Divergence


Compared to {{< c "wiki/machine-learning/basics/kl-divergence.md" >}} or more generally {{< c "cards/information/f-divergence.md" >}}, CRPS is comparing our proposed CDF to the Heaviside CDF.

## Applications


One quite interesting application of the CRPS is to write down the loss for an the quantile function[^Gouttes2021].
