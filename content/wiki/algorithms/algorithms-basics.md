There are many useful books to learn about algorithms from a utilitarian point of view. I have listed a few in the references section.

Numerical recipes[^numrec] is a very comprehensive book that I used during my PhD. It covers almost all the algorithms you need for scientific computing.

Grokking Algorithms[^Aditya2016] is another good book to learn the basics of algorithms. It is barely entry level but is fun to read.
