## Basic Concepts of Colors

### Color Wheel and Color Sphere


There are two dimensions in the color wheel:
- Hue
- [Saturation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorfulness#Saturation)

When we add another dimension, lightness, to the wheel, we have a color sphere ([1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tints_and_shades), [2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_solid#/media/File:Color_solid_comparison_hsl_hsv_rgb_cone_sphere_cube_cylinder.png)).

Many color systems have been invented. Color wheel and color sphere are two examples of them.
