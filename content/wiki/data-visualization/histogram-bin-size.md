Histograms are good for understanding the distribution of your data.

## The Bin Size Problem

As an example, we will use the following series as an example.
```
[1.45,2.20,0.75,1.23,1.25,1.25,3.09,1.99,2.00,0.78,1.32,2.25,3.15,3.85,0.52,0.99,1.38,1.75,1.21,1.75]
```

If we use bin size 1, we get this spiky chart and it is not so informing.

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div id="histogram-1">
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

We could also set bin size to 2.

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div id="histogram-2">
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

In principle, we could keep tuning the bin size until we get something pretty and informing. But that would be quite depressing.


## Square-root

One simply way to estimate the number of bins needed is

$$B = \sqrt{N} ,$$

where $N$ is the lenght of the series.

In our example, $N=20$. Then we have $B=4.5\sim 5$ which leads to a bin size of $0.67$.

{{< rawhtml >}}
<div id="histogram-squareroot">
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}

We immediately see the peak of this distribution.

## Sturge’s formula


Sturges' formula says that the number of bins of the histogram should be

$$
B = 1 + \log_2(N),
$$

where $N$ is the lenght of the series.

In our example, $N=20$. We have $B = 5$. The max and min of our series are $3.85$ and $0.52$, thus we have the bin size $W = 0.67$ which is the same as the square-root method.

<div id="histogram-sturges">
</div>
{{< /rawhtml >}}




## Scott's Rule

Scott's rule says we should choose bin width

$$W = 3.49 \sigma N^{-1/3}$$

In our case, we have $N=20$ and $\sigma=0.86$, which leads to $W=1.1$.
