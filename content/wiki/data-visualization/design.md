There are many principles of designing a visual representation of data. However, before we understand how data is represented visually, it would benefit us a lot if we understand the basic principles of designing on 2D surface.

## Robin's CRAP

Robin Williams proposed the four elements of design:
- Contrast
- Repetition
- Alignment
- Proximity

### Contrast

Use some contrast to distinguish the elements of different contents.

### Repetition

Repeat the design of similar elements on the same page and across pages to make sure the readers learn the meaning of the design quickly.

### Alignment

> Find a strong line and stick to it.
>
> -- Robin Williams

Some suggestions from Robin Williams:
- Use less centered designs.
- Alignment inside blocks and alignment of blocks can be different.


### Proximity

The spatial relations of the contents also indicate the relations of the contents.
