## The Three Key Ideas about Warehouse

The purpose of the data warehouse should be clear. In most cases, it is for the analysis of data, not for data production.[^1]

1. Subject-oriented: since data warehouses are for decision-makers, arrange them into subjects makes it much easier to access.
2. Integrated: many sources are integrated for easy analysis
3. Time-variant: observation time should be recorded since the data is also used to analyze the time evolution
4. Nonvolatile: simply for analysis


## OLTP and OLAP

1. OLTP: online transaction processing
2. OLAP: online analytical processing

|      | OLTP |  OLAP |
|:---:|:-----:|:----:|
| user |    customer  |   data scientist, managers   |
| purpose | production | analysis  |
| content | everything | cleaner data |
| database | entity relation model, application-oriented | star/snowflake model, subject-oriented |
| history | usually no need to record the history | history is crucial |
| query | short and frequent read and write | read-only and but complicated analysis |


## Scope of Data Warehouse

1. Enterprise warehouse: targeting the whole organization
2. Data mart: for a specific group of people
3. Virtual warehouse: views not tables


## Fact and Dimension

**Fact** is the value of something specified by the **dimension**. For example, we have a table that tells us the revenue of the year 2018 for keyboards is 3 million euros.

|  `Year` | `Category`  |  Revenue |
|--|---|---|
| 2017 | Keyboard | 2,500,000 |
| 2017 | Headset | 200,000 |
| 2018 | Keyboard | 3,000,000 |
| 2018 | Headset | 134,000  |

The columns `Year` and `Category` serve as dimensions and `Revenue` serves as the fact.

The dimension tells us what we are talking about and the fact tells us the values. For the previous example, we could set up a coordinate system, with two axes, `Year` and `Category`. On the `Year` axis, we have two values, `2017` and `2018`. On the `Category` axis, we have two values `Keyboard` and `Headset`. If we are looking for the revenue of keyboards in 2018, then we are looking for `2018` and `Headset`. It is clearly a 2 dimensional **data cube**.


In principle, we could have N-dimensional **data cube**. For example, we would like to look at the revenue of

1. keyboards (`Category`),
2. in 2018 (`Year`),
3. in Cologne (`City`),
4. sold offline (`Channel`).

Then we have a 4-dimensional dataset. Revenue is the fact and `Category`, `Year`, `City` and `Channel` are the dimensions.



## Concept Hierarchies

Concept hierarchies are crucial to OLAP operations.

We consider a data cube about revenue with the dimension `Date` with values such as 2018-11-26. We would like to know the monthly revenue, the quarterly revenue, and the annual revenue. It's straightforward to calculate those. The idea is that monthly, quarterly, and annual revenue form a hierarchy: day $\in$ month $\in$ quarter $\in$ year. This is a convention used by everyone on this planet.

In some other cases, concept hierarchies are very much designed instead of being a convention. Suppose we record the prices of houses. It would be nice to categorize the prices into different ranges of prices. Some would say, we divide them into five ranges:
1. below 25 percentile
2. 25 to 50 percentile
3. 50 to 75 percentile
4. above 75 percentile

Others would say, we divide them into 100 euros segments
1. 0 to 100 euros
2. 100 to 200 euros
3. ...



[^1]: In fact, this is not always the case. Sometimes, data products can be delivered using some assist of data warehouse if data product doesn't rely on the performance of the data source.
