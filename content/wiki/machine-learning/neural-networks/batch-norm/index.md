Batch norm is a normalization method to relieve the internal covariate shift[^Rohrer-Batch-Normalization].


[David Page created a colab notebook to](https://colab.research.google.com/github/davidcpage/cifar10-fast/blob/master/batch_norm_post.ipynb#scrollTo=yXu58M6ZLayL) provide some real examples of how batch norm helps with the internal covariance shift.
