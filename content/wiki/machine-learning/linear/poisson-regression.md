Poisson regression is a generalized linear model for count data.

To model a dataset that is generated from a {{< c "cards/statistics/poisson-process.md" "Poisson distribution" >}}, we only need to model the mean $\mu$ as it is the only parameters. The simplest model we can have for some given features $X$ is a linear model. However, for count data, the effects of the predictors are often multiplicative. The next simplest model we can have is

{{< m >}}
\mu = \exp\left(\beta X\right).
{{< /m >}}

The $\exp$ makes sure that the mean is positive as this is required for count data.
