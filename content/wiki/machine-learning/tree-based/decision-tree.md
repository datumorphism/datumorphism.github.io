In this article, we will explain how decision trees work and build a tree by hand.

## Definition of the problem

We will decide whether one should go to work today. In this demo project, we consider the following features.

| feature | possible values |
|:----:|:---:|
| health | 0: feeling bad, 1: feeling good |
| weather | 0: bad weather, 1: good weather |
| holiday | 1: holiday, 0: not holiday |

{{< message class="info" >}}
For more compact notations, we use the abstract notation $\\{0,1\\}^3$ to describe a set of three features each with 0 and 1 as possible values. In general, the notation $\\{0,1\\}^d$ indicates $d$ binary features.
{{< /message >}}

Our prediction will be a binary result, 0 or 1, with 0 indicates staying at home and 1 indicates going to work.

{{< message class="info" >}}
To be compact, this prediction can be denoted as $\\{0,1\\}^1$.

## How to Describe a Decision Tree

In theory, we would expect a decision tree of the following.

{{< mermaid >}}
graph TD
  A[health] --> |feeling bad| E[stay home]
  A[health] --> |feeling good| B[weather]
  B --> |bad weather| E
  B --> |good weather| C[holiday]
  C --> |holiday| E
  C --> |not holiday| G[go to the office]
{{< /mermaid >}}

{{< message class="info" >}}
It is straight forward to prove that the max required depths and max required leaves of a model that maps $\\{0,1\\}^d$ to $\\{0,1\\}^1$ are $d+1$ and $2^d$. In our simple example, some of the branches are truncated based on our understanding of the problem. In principle, the branch "feeling bad" could also go on to the next level.

## Data

**However, we do not forge trees using experience. We build the tree using data.**

The following is a sample of the full dataset.

|    |   health |   weather |   holiday |   go_to_office |
|---:|---------:|----------:|----------:|---------------:|
|  0 |        0 |         0 |         1 |              0 |
|  1 |        1 |         1 |         1 |              0 |
|  2 |        1 |         0 |         1 |              0 |
|  3 |        0 |         0 |         0 |              0 |
|  4 |        1 |         0 |         1 |              0 |

## Build a Tree

{{< figure src="../assets/decision-tree/decision_tree_100_pure.png" caption="A decision tree trained with the dataset." >}}


{{< card title="Reading the Decision Tree Chart" >}}
### Reading the Decision Tree Chart

On each node of the tree, we read loads of information.

We will look into the root node as an example. The feature name and value range are denoted on the first row, i.e., **weather<= 0.5**, which means that we are making decisions based on whether the value of the weather feature less or equal to 0.5. If the value is less or equal to 0.5, we go the left branch, otherwise, we go to the right branch. The following rows in the node are assuming the condition is satisfied.

On the second row, we read the **gini** impurity value. Gini impurity is a measure of the impurity of the data under the condition.

On the third row, samples of the given condition (weather <= 0.5) is also given.

Finally, we read the values of the samples. In this example, value = [93, 7], i.e., 93 of the samples have target value 0, 7 of the samples have target value 1.
{{< /card >}}

This is a very good result. It is the same as our theoretical expectations.

{{< card title="Surely it will. We forged the dataset based on the theoretical expectations." >}}

Surely it will. We forged the dataset based on the theoretical expectations.

Here is an example of using data that doesn't always fit into our theoretical model.

## Overfitting

Fully grown trees will most likely to overfit the data since they always try to grow pure leaves. Besides, fully grown trees grow exponentially as the number of features grow which requires a lot of computation resources.

{{< message class="warning" >}}
Applying Occam's razor, we prefer smaller trees as long as the trees can explain the data well.
{{< /message >}}


To achieve this, we will either have to limit how the trees grow during training, or pruning the trees after the trees are built.

Pruning of a tree is achieved by replacing subtrees at a node with a leaf if some certain conditions based on cost estimations.

## Remarks

The Iterative Dichotomizer 3 algorithm, aka ID3 algorithm, is one of the most famous implementations of the decision tree. The following is the "flowchart" of the algorithm.

  AssignL(Assign label to left node)
  Left --> MajorityVoteL --> AssignL
  end

  subgraph "right node"
  MajorityVoteR["Calculate majority vote"]
  Right -->  MajorityVoteR
  AssignR(Assign label to right node)
  MajorityVoteR --> AssignR
  end

To "calculate the gain of the split", we use information gain or Gini impurity.
