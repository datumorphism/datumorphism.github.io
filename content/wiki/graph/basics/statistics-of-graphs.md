## Local Statistics

### Node Degree

{{< e ref="cards/graph/node-degree.md" >}}


### Node Centrality

Importance of a node on a graph:

- {{< e "cards/graph/graph-eigenvector-centrality.md" >}}
- {{< e "cards/graph/graph-betweenness-centrality.md" >}}
- Closeness centrality


### Clustering Coefficients


Proportion of motifs, e.g., closed triangles, in a node's neighborhood.

## Graph Level Statistics

### Bag of Nodes

Using the statistics of the local statistics, e.g., distribution of node degrees, as graph level statistics.

### Weisfeiler-Lehmen Kernel

## Neighborhood Overlap

We can define many different similarity measures $\mathbf S$.

- Number of shared neighbor nodes: $\mathbf S[u, v] = \lvert \mathcal N(u) \cap \mathcal N(v) \rvert$. The likelihood of an edge between $u$ and $v$, $P(A[u,v]=1) \propto \mathcal S[u,v]$.
