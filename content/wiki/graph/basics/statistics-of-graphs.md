## Local Statistics

### Node Degree

{{< c "cards/graph/node-degree.md" >}}


### Node Centrality

Importance of a node on a graph:

- {{< c "cards/graph/graph-eigenvector-centrality.md" >}}
- {{< c "cards/graph/graph-betweenness-centrality.md" >}}
- Closeness centrality


### Clustering Coefficients


Proportion of motifs, e.g., closed triangles, in a node's neighborhood.

## Graph Level Statistics

### Bag of Nodes

Using the statistics of the local statistics, e.g., distribution of node degrees, as graph level statistics.
