For example, the sample mean is easily calculated. However, it is the population mean that is more valuable.
Suppose we have one sample $S_i$, which is used to calculate the mean of the sample $\mu_i$. We have two key problems to solve at this moment.
Can we use this sample mean $\mu_i$ to represent the population mean $\mu_p$? How good is our estimations? To answer these questions, we need to work out the properties of the samples themselves and work out a theory to instruct us to infer population statistics from sample statistics.</description></item><item><title>Confidence Interval</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-estimation/confidence-interval/</link><pubDate>Sun, 20 Jan 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-estimation/confidence-interval/</guid><description>We will use upper cases for the abstract variable and lower cases for the actual numbers.
Why is Confidence Interval Needed? Suppose I sample the population multiple times, the mean value $\mu_i$ of the sample is calculated for each sample. It is a good question to ask how different these $\mu_i$ are compared to the true mean $\mu_p$ of the population.
In this article, we would need to specify several notations.
$X$ is the quantity we are measuring. $\bar X$ is the mean of the quantity $X$. Confidence Interval This theorem states that the probability for the true mean $\mu_p$ to fall into a specific range can be calculated using</description></item><item><title>Conformal Prediction</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-estimation/conformal-prediction/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/wiki/statistical-estimation/conformal-prediction/</guid><description>Conformal prediction is a method to predict a consistent confidence interval in an on-line setting. The algorithms is following the [[Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing]] Neyman-Pearson Theory The Neyman-Pearson hypothesis testing tests two hypothesis, hypothesis $H$, and an alternative hypothesis $H_A$. Neyman-Pearson Lemma The Neyman-Pearson Lemma is an very intuitive lemma to understand how to choose a hypothesis. The lecture notes from PennState is a very good read on this topic1. An example For simplicity, we assume that there exists a test statistic $T$ and $T$ can be used to measure how likely the hypothesis $H$ is true, e.g., the hypothesis $H$ is false, corresponds to $T$ â€¦ framework, thus providing solid theoretical support for the predicted region.</description></item></channel></rss>
