In this article, we perform an association rule analysis of some demo data.
The Problem Defined Suppose we own a store called KIOSK. Here at KIOSK, we sell 4 different things.
Milk Croissant Coffee Fries We need to know what items are associated with each other when the customers are buying.
We have collected the following data. Beware that this small amount of data might not be enough for a real-world problem.
INDEX Items 1 croissant, milk 2 coffee, croissant 3 coffee, croissant 4 coffee, croissant, milk 5 coffee, milk 6 fries, milk 7 coffee, croissant, fries 8 croissant, fries 9 croissant, milk 10 croissant, fries, milk 11 coffee, croissant, milk The Rule, Support, and Confidence The Association rule has three components: the rule, the support, and the confidence.</description></item></channel></rss>
