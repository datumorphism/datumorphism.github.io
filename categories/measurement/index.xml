Suppose we know the actual generating process of the dataset and the joint probability density distribution of all the data points is $p(x, y)$, the population loss is defined on the whole assumed population,
$$ \begin{align} \mathcal L_{P} = \mathop{\mathbb{E}}_{p(x,y)}[ d(y, f(x))], \end{align} $$
where $d(y, f(x))$ is the distance defined between $y$ and $f(x)$.</description></item><item><title>Gini Impurity</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/measurement/gini-impurity/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/measurement/gini-impurity/</guid><description>The code used in this article can be found in this repo. Suppose we have a dataset $\{0,1\}^{10}$, which has 10 records and 2 possible classes of objects $\{0,1\}$ in each record.
The first example we investigate is a pure 0 dataset.
object 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 For such an all-0 dataset, we would like to define its impurity as 0.</description></item><item><title>Information Gain</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/measurement/information-gain/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/measurement/information-gain/</guid><description>Information gain is a frequently used metric in calculating the gain during a split in tree-based methods.
First o all, the entropy of a dataset if defined as
$$ S = - sum_i p_i \log p_i - sum_i (1-p_i)\log p_i, $$
where $p_i$ is the probability of a class.
The information gain is the difference between the entropy.
For example, in a decision tree algorithm, we would split a node. Before splitting, we assign a label $m$ to the node,
$$ S_m = - p_m \log p_m - (1-p_m)\log p_m. $$
After the splitting, we have two groups that contributes to the entropy, group $L$ and group $R$,</description></item></channel></rss>
