For any subset of $\mathcal S$, denoted as $\mathcal s$, if we have an element of class $\mathcal H$, denoted as $\mathcal h$, that leads to1
$$ \mathcal h \cap \mathcal S = \mathcal s. $$
Since the power set of $\mathcal S$ ($P(\mathcal S)$) contains all the possible subsets of $\mathcal S$, we can also rephrase the concept using power set. If we can find the power set $P(\mathcal S)$ by looking into intersections of elements $\mathcal h$ of $\mathcal H$ ($\mathcal h\in \mathcal H$), then we say $\mathcal H$ shatters $\mathcal S$ 1.</description></item><item><title>Noise Contrastive Estimation: NCE</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/learning-theories/noise-contrastive-estimation/</link><pubDate>Fri, 13 Aug 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/learning-theories/noise-contrastive-estimation/</guid><description>Noise contrastive estimation (NCE) objective function is1
$$ \mathcal L = \mathbb E_{x, x^{+}, x^{-}} \left[ - \ln \frac{ C(x, x^{+})}{ C(x,x^{+}) + C(x,x^{-}) } \right], $$
where
$x^{+}$ represents data similar to $x$, $x^{-}$ represents data dissimilar to $x$, $C(\cdot, \cdot)$ is a function to compute the similarities. For example, we can use
$$ C(x, x^{+}) = e^{ f(x)^T f(x^{+}) }, $$
so that the objective function becomes
$$ \mathcal L = \mathbb E_{x, x^{+}, x^{-}} \left[ - \ln \frac{ e^{ f(x)^T f(x^{+}) } }{ e^{ f(x)^T f(x^{+}) } + e^{ f(x)^T f(x^{-}) } } \right]. $$</description></item><item><title>Cross Validation</title><link>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/learning-theories/cross-validation/</link><pubDate>Thu, 06 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://datumorphism.leima.is/cards/machine-learning/learning-theories/cross-validation/</guid><description>Cross validation is a method to estimate the [[risk]] The Learning Problem The learning problem posed by Vapnik:1 Given a sample: $\{z_i\}$ in the probability space $Z$; Assuming a probability measure on the probability space $Z$; Assuming a set of functions $Q(z, \alpha)$ (e.g. loss functions), where $\alpha$ is a set of parameters; A risk functional to be minimized by tunning &amp;ldquo;the handles&amp;rdquo; $\alpha$, $R(\alpha)$.
