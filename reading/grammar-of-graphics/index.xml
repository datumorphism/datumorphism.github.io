Specification Assembly Display Specification Statistical graphic specifications are expressed in six statements
DATA: a set of data operations that create variables from datasets TRANS: variable transformations (e.g., rank) SCALE: scale transformations (e.g., log) COORD: a coordinate system (e.g., polar) ELEMENT: graphs (e.g., points) and their aesthetic attributes (e.g., color) GUIDE: one or more guides (axes, legends, etc.) Assembly Assembling a scene from a specification requires a variety of structures in order to index and link components with each other.
