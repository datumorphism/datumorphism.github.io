summary: Symmetry of second derivatives
---


[This wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_of_second_derivatives#Requirement_of_continuity) shows an example of symmetry breaking of the second derivatives, that is $\partial_x\partial_y f \ne \partial_y\partial_x f$. The example is

$$
f(x,y) = \begin{cases}
\frac{xy(x^2-y^2)}{x^2+y^2} & \mbox{ for } (x,y) \ne (0,0) \\
0 & \mbox{ for } (x,y) = (0,0).
 \end{cases}
$$

A image of the function is shown on wikipedia.
